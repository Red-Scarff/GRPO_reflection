Failed to parse gold solution:  p'(x) has a factor (x-1) 2 and a factor (x+1) 2 , but it has degree 4, so p'(x) = a(x 2 -1) 2 = ax 4 - 2ax 2 + a. Integrating, p(x) = ax 5 /5 - 2ax 3 /3 + ax + b. We have p(1) = -1, so a/5 - 2a/3 + a + b = -1, or 8a + 15b = -15. Also p(-1) = 1, so -a/5 + 2a/3 - a + b = 1, or -8a + 15b = 15. Hence a = -15/8, b = 0 and p(x) = (-3x 5 + 10x 3 - 15x)/8 Thanks to Suat Namli 21st Swedish 1981 © John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 27 February 2004 Last corrected/updated 27 Feb 04

Failed to parse gold solution:  [Solution] Since the larger the difference between the last two numbers is, the more advantageous it is for Player A, therefore, every time Player A crosses out numbers, the minimum difference between any two remaining numbers should be as large as possible. Every time Player B crosses out numbers, the maximum difference between any two remaining numbers should be as small as possible.

Player A first crosses out all 512 odd numbers. Then, regardless of which numbers Player B crosses out, Player A, in the second round, first crosses out all even numbers that are not multiples of 4. If not enough, Player A can randomly cross out some more numbers until the required number is reached. This continues until the fifth round, when Player A crosses out all numbers that are not multiples of 32. Thus, the difference between any two remaining numbers is no less than 32, so Player A will score at least 32 points.

When it is Player B's turn for the first time, Player A has already crossed out 512 numbers. Player B only needs to recognize which of the first 512 numbers and the last 512 numbers has more remaining numbers. Player B can then cross out all the numbers from the part with fewer remaining numbers, and if not enough, continue crossing out until the required number is reached. Thus, the maximum difference between any two remaining numbers does not exceed 512. Each subsequent time it is Player B's turn, the same strategy is followed. Each time, the maximum difference between any two remaining numbers can be reduced by at least half, until the 10th step when 1 number is crossed out, leaving the difference between any two remaining numbers no more than 32.
Thus, when both players play correctly, the score that Player B has to pay to Player A is 32.

Failed to parse gold solution:  Since 5, 20, and 35 are all divisible by 5, the number of tickets bought for a single ride is also divisible by 5. However, it is more cost-effective to replace every five such tickets with one ticket for five rides. Therefore, there is no need to buy tickets for a single ride. For the same reason, it is most cost-effective to buy three tickets for five rides and one ticket for 20 rides, which costs exactly 33 coins, while seven tickets for five rides cost more. Therefore, a ticket for five rides costs no less than 5 coins.

On the other hand, according to the condition, it is more cost-effective to pay for 35 rides than to buy two tickets for 20 rides, meaning that three tickets for five rides are cheaper than one for 20. Therefore, six tickets for five rides cost less than 33 coins, meaning that one such ticket costs no more than five coins.

## Answer

5 coins.

Failed to parse gold solution:  Answer: 1999999999.

Solution. Among 9-digit numbers, the largest sum of digits is for the number 999999 999, which is 81. Since the sought 10-digit number is greater than 999999 999, we need to find the smallest number with a sum of digits no less than 82. If the first digit of this number is 1, then the sum of the remaining digits must be no less than 81, which means the other nine digits are nines.

Criteria. Correct answer without explanation - 1 point. Proven that the sum of digits of the sought number is greater than 81 - 3 points. Complete solution - 7 points.

If the unit digit 3 of the minuend is written as 5, then the minuend increases by 2, and the difference increases by 2, so it should be subtracted; if the tens digit 6 of the minuend is written as 0, then the minuend decreases by 60, and the difference decreases by 60, so it should be added; if the hundreds digit 7 of the subtrahend is written as 2, then the subtrahend decreases by 500, and the difference increases by 500, so it should be subtracted; therefore, the correct difference should be 1994-500+60-2=1552.
