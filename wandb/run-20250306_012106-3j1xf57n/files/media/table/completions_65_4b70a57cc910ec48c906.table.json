I need to find an integer n between 0 and 100 inclusive such that 100n is congruent to 72 modulo 101. Hmm, modular arithmetic problems can sometimes be tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem is asking for 100n \u2261 72 mod 101. So, essentially, I need to solve for n in this congruence equation. Since we're dealing with modulo 101, which is a prime number, I remember that in modular arithmetic with primes, there are multiplicative inverses for any number that isn't a multiple of the modulus. That should be helpful here because 100 and 101 are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1), so 100 should have an inverse modulo 101.\n\nSo, maybe I can find the inverse of 100 modulo 101 and then multiply both sides of the equation by that inverse to solve for n. Let me recall how to find an inverse. The inverse of a number a modulo m is a number x such that ax \u2261 1 mod m. So, I need to find x where 100x \u2261 1 mod 101. Once I have x, then multiplying both sides of 100n \u2261 72 mod 101 by x should give me n \u2261 72x mod 101.\n\nNow, how do I find x such that 100x \u2261 1 mod 101? One method is the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which finds integers x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a,b). Since 100 and 101 are coprime, their gcd is 1, so we can find x and y such that 100x + 101y = 1. The x here will be my inverse modulo 101.\n\nLet me try applying the Extended Euclidean Algorithm step by step.\n\nWe start with the two numbers: 101 and 100.\n\nFirst step: Divide 101 by 100. That gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 1. So, 101 = 1*100 + 1.\n\nSecond step: Now take 100 and the remainder from the previous step, which is 1. Divide 100 by 1. The quotient is 100 and remainder is 0. So, 100 = 100*1 + 0.\n\nSince the remainder is now 0, the algorithm stops. The last non-zero remainder is 1, which confirms they are coprime. Now, working backwards to express 1 as a linear combination:\n\nFrom the first step: 1 = 101 - 1*100.\n\nSo, 1 = 101 - 100*1.\n\nThat means x is -1, right? Because 100*(-1) + 101*1 = 1. Therefore, the inverse of 100 modulo 101 is -1. But we want a positive inverse between 0 and 100. So, -1 mod 101 is the same as 100 mod 101. Therefore, the inverse is 100.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that. If x is -1 modulo 101, then x = -1 + 101 = 100. So yes, 100 is the inverse of 100 modulo 101. Let me verify that 100*100 mod 101 is indeed 1.\n\nCalculating 100*100 = 10,000. Now divide 10,000 by 101. Let me see how many times 101 goes into 10,000. 101*99 = 9999. So 10,000 - 9999 = 1. Therefore, 100*100 \u2261 1 mod 101. Perfect, that checks out. So the inverse is indeed 100.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original equation: 100n \u2261 72 mod 101. Multiply both sides by 100 (the inverse):\n\nn \u2261 72*100 mod 101.\n\nSo, n \u2261 7200 mod 101.

In other words, 100n \u2261 72 mod 101. Hmm, let me think step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that solving congruences often involves finding the multiplicative inverse. Since 100 and 101 are consecutive integers, I think they are coprime. Let me check: gcd(100,101). Since 101 is a prime number and 100 is less than 101, their gcd should be 1. Yep, that's correct. So, 1 has an inverse modulo 101, which means I can multiply both sides of the congruence by that inverse to solve for n.\n\nSo the equation is 100n \u2261 72 mod 101. Let me write this as 100n = 101k + 72 for some integer k. My goal is to find n such that this equation holds. \n\nTo isolate n, I need to find the inverse of 100 modulo 101. The inverse of 100 mod 101 is a number x such that 100x \u2261 1 mod 101. Once I have x, then multiplying both sides of the original equation by x will give me n \u2261 72x mod 101. \n\nSo, let me find x where 100x \u2261 1 mod 101. Since 100 is -1 mod 101 (because 100 = 101 - 1). Therefore, 100x \u2261 (-1)x \u2261 -x \u2261 1 mod 101. So, solving -x \u2261 1 mod 101 is the same as x \u2261 -1 mod 101, which is x \u2261 100 mod 101. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify.\n\nIf x \u2261 100 mod 101, then 100x \u2261 100*100 = 10000. Let's compute 10000 mod 101. To do that, I can note that 101*99 = 100*99 + 99 = 9900 + 99 = 9999. Therefore, 10000 = 101*99 + 1, so 10000 \u2261 1 mod 101. Yes, that works! So x = 100 is the inverse of 100 modulo 101. Therefore, multiplying both sides of the original equation by 100 gives:\n\nn \u2261 72*100 mod 101.\n\nNow, compute 72*100. 72*100 is 7200. Now, find 7200 mod 101. Let me do this step by step.\n\nFirst, note that 101*71 = 7171. Subtract that from 7200: 7200 - 7171 = 29. Therefore, 7200 \u2261 29 mod 101. Therefore, n \u2261 29 mod 101. Since n is between 0 and 100, n = 29.\n\nWait, let me verify this result to make sure. Let's check if 100*29 \u2261 72 mod 101.\n\nCompute 100*29: 2900. Now, divide 2900 by 101. Let me compute 2900 \u00f7 101. \n\n101*28 = 2828. 2900 - 2828 = 72. Therefore, 2900 \u2261 72 mod 101. Perfect, that's correct. So n = 29.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another way. Let me try solving 100n \u2261 72 mod 101 by another method, just to confirm.\n\nAnother approach: Solve 100n \u2261 72 mod 101. Let's represent this as 100n - 72 = 101k for some integer k.

Hmm, let's see. I need to solve this congruence equation. Let me recall how to approach modular equations like this.\n\nFirst, the equation is 100n \u2261 72 mod 101. Since 101 is a prime number, maybe I can use the properties of primes in modular arithmetic. Specifically, if modulus is prime, then every number from 1 to modulus -1 has a multiplicative inverse. So here, 100 and 101 are coprime (since 101 is prime and 100 is less than 101), so 100 has an inverse modulo 101. Therefore, to solve for n, I can multiply both sides by the inverse of 100 mod 101.\n\nSo the plan is: find the inverse of 100 modulo 101, then multiply 72 by that inverse to get n.\n\nNow, how do I find the inverse of 100 mod 101? The inverse of a number a modulo m is a number x such that ax \u2261 1 mod m. So I need to find x where 100x \u2261 1 mod 101. One way to find this is by the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. Let me try that.\n\nThe Extended Euclidean Algorithm finds integers x and y such that ax + my = gcd(a, m). Since 101 is prime, gcd(100, 101) = 1, so the algorithm should give a solution for x.\n\nLet me apply the algorithm step by step.\n\nCompute gcd(101, 100):\n\n101 divided by 100 is 1 with a remainder of 1. So:\n\n101 = 100*1 + 1\n\nThen, 100 divided by 1 is 100 with a remainder of 0. So:\n\n100 = 1*100 + 0\n\nTherefore, gcd(100, 101) is 1, as we already knew. Now, to express 1 as a linear combination:\n\nStarting from the first equation:\n\n1 = 101 - 100*1\n\nSo here, x is -1 and y is 1. Therefore, the inverse of 100 mod 101 is -1. But we want a positive inverse, so we can add 101 to -1 to get 100. Let me check: 100*100 mod 101.\n\nCalculating 100*100 = 10000. Dividing 10000 by 101: 101*99 = 9999, so 10000 - 9999 = 1. So yes, 100*100 \u2261 1 mod 101. Therefore, the inverse of 100 mod 101 is indeed 100.\n\nSo now, going back to the original equation: 100n \u2261 72 mod 101. Multiply both sides by 100:\n\n100*100n \u2261 100*72 mod 101\n\nBut 100*100 \u2261 1 mod 101, so this simplifies to:\n\nn \u2261 72*100 mod 101\n\nTherefore, n \u2261 7200 mod 101. Now I need to compute 7200 divided by 101 to find the remainder.\n\nLet me compute 7200 \u00f7 101. Let's see how many times 101 fits into 7200.\n\nFirst, 101*70 = 7070. Then 7200 - 7070 = 130. Then 130 \u00f7 101 is 1 with remainder 29.\n\nSo 101*(70 + 1) = 101*71 = 7171. Then 7200 - 7171 = 29. Therefore, 7200 \u2261 29 mod 101. So n \u2261 29 mod 101.\n\nBut since we need n to be in the range 0 \u2264 n < 101,", 0.38999998569488525], ["35", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

The goal is to find an integer n such that 0 \u2264 n < 101 and 100n \u2261 72 mod 101. Hmm, modular inverses... I remember that to solve equations like this, especially when dealing with moduli that are prime numbers, we can use the concept of modular inverses. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, the equation given is 100n \u2261 72 mod 101. To solve for n, I need to find the multiplicative inverse of 100 modulo 101 because if I can multiply both sides by that inverse, it should cancel out the 100, leaving me with n on the left side. So, the key step here is finding the inverse of 100 modulo 101.\n\nSince 101 is a prime number, the modulus here is prime, which means that every number from 1 to 100 has an inverse modulo 101. That\u2019s good because it ensures that 100 has an inverse. \n\nTo find the inverse of 100 mod 101, I need a number x such that 100x \u2261 1 mod 101. Once I find x, then multiplying both sides of the original equation by x will give me n \u2261 72x mod 101.\n\nNow, how do I find x? I think the Extended Euclidean Algorithm is the way to go here. Let me recall how that works. The Extended Euclidean Algorithm finds integers x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a, b). In this case, a is 100 and b is 101, and since 101 is prime, gcd(100, 101) is 1. Therefore, there exist integers x and y such that 100x + 101y = 1, and x will be the inverse of 100 modulo 101.\n\nSo let's apply the Extended Euclidean Algorithm step by step to 100 and 101.\n\nStarting with 101 and 100:\n\n101 divided by 100 is 1 with a remainder of 1. So,\n\n101 = 1 * 100 + 1\n\nThen, since the remainder is 1, we can backtrack. The next step is to express 1 as a combination of 101 and 100. From the first equation:\n\n1 = 101 - 1 * 100\n\nSo here, x = -1 and y = 1. Therefore, the inverse of 100 mod 101 is -1. But we need a positive inverse, so we can add 101 to -1 to make it positive. -1 + 101 = 100. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check.\n\nWait, if x is -1, then 100 * (-1) \u2261 -100 mod 101. Let's compute -100 mod 101. Since 101 - 100 = 1, then -100 \u2261 1 mod 101. Yes, that's correct. So the inverse of 100 modulo 101 is -1, which is equivalent to 100. So n \u2261 72 * 100 mod 101.\n\nWait, hold on, that seems straightforward, but let me verify this step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's compute 100 * 100 mod 101.\n\n100 * 100 = 10,000. Dividing 10,000 by 101: 101 * 99 = 9999. Then 10,000 - 9999 = 1. So 10000 \u2261 1 mod 101. Therefore, 100 * 100 \u2261 1 mod 101. So yes, the inverse of 100 is indeed 100 modulo 101. Therefore, 100 is its own inverse. Interesting.\n\nTherefore, multiplying both sides of the original equation by 100 gives:\n\nn \u2261 72 * 100 mod 101.\n\nLet me compute 72 * 100. That's 7200.

That means 100n \u2261 72 mod 101. Hmm, this looks like a linear congruence equation. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that solving equations like ax \u2261 b mod m usually involves finding the modular inverse of a modulo m, provided that a and m are coprime. In this case, a is 100 and m is 101. Let me check if they are coprime. Since 101 is a prime number, and 100 is less than 101, they share no common factors other than 1. So yes, they are coprime. That means an inverse of 100 modulo 101 exists. Perfect, so I can solve for n by multiplying both sides of the equation by this inverse.\n\nSo the general approach would be: multiply both sides by 100^{-1} mod 101, which would give n \u2261 72 * 100^{-1} mod 101. Now, I need to find the inverse of 100 modulo 101. How do I find that?\n\nI recall that the inverse of a number a modulo m is a number x such that a*x \u2261 1 mod m. So here, I need to find x where 100x \u2261 1 mod 101. Since 101 is a prime, maybe I can use Fermat's little theorem here. Fermat's little theorem states that for any integer a not divisible by a prime p, a^{p-1} \u2261 1 mod p. So, 100^{100} \u2261 1 mod 101. Therefore, 100^{-1} \u2261 100^{99} mod 101. That seems like a big exponent to compute, but maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, I might use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the inverse. Let's try that. The Extended Euclidean Algorithm finds integers x and y such that 100x + 101y = 1. Then x would be the inverse of 100 modulo 101.\n\nLet me set up the algorithm step by step.\n\nFirst, divide 101 by 100:\n101 = 1*100 + 1\n\nThen divide 100 by the remainder 1:\n100 = 100*1 + 0\n\nSo the algorithm terminates here. Now, working backwards to express 1 as a combination of 101 and 100.\n\nFrom the first step:\n1 = 101 - 1*100\n\nSo, rearranged, 1 = -1*100 + 1*101\n\nTherefore, x is -1, which would mean that -1 is the coefficient for 100. But we want a positive inverse modulo 101. Since -1 mod 101 is 100, so the inverse of 100 mod 101 is 100. Wait, let's check this. If 100 * 100 = 10,000. Let's compute 10,000 mod 101.\n\nDivide 10,000 by 101. Let's compute how many times 101 goes into 10,000.\n\n101*99 = 101*(100 -1) = 101*100 - 101 = 10,100 - 101 = 9,999. Then 10,000 - 9,999 = 1. So 101*99 +1 = 10,000. Therefore, 10,000 \u2261 1 mod 101. So yes, 100*100 \u2261 1 mod 101. Therefore, 100^{-1} mod 101 is indeed 100.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the inverse is 100.

Once found, x will be the inverse of 100 modulo 101.\n\nLet's apply the algorithm step by step:\n\n101 divided by 100 gives quotient 1 and remainder 1. So, 101 = 100*1 + 1.\n\nThen, 100 divided by 1 gives quotient 100 and remainder 0. So, 100 = 1*100 + 0.\n\nThe GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 1. Now, working backwards:\n\nFrom the first equation: 1 = 101 - 100*1.\n\nTherefore, x = -1. So, the inverse of 100 mod 101 is -1. But since we usually want a positive representative, we can convert -1 to a positive number by adding 101. So, -1 + 101 = 100. Wait, that's interesting. So the inverse is 100 mod 101?\n\nLet me check: 100*100 = 10000. What's 10000 mod 101? Let's compute 101*99 = 9999. So, 10000 - 9999 = 1. Therefore, 100*100 \u2261 1 mod 101. Yes, so 100 is indeed its own inverse modulo 101. Okay, that's a neat property. So the inverse is 100.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original equation: 100n \u2261 72 mod 101.

Therefore, n is the remainder when 7200 is divided by 101.\n\nNow, let's compute 7200 divided by 101. To do this, maybe I can break it down. Let's see how many times 101 goes into 7200.\n\nFirst, note that 101*70 = 7070. Let's check: 101*70 = 7070. Then 7200 - 7070 = 130. 130 is still larger than 101. Then, 101*1 = 101, so 130 - 101 = 29.

I need to find an integer n such that 0 \u2264 n < 101 and 100n \u2261 72 mod 101. Hmm. So basically, I have to solve this congruence equation. Let me recall how to solve linear congruences. The general method is to find the modular inverse of 100 modulo 101 and then multiply both sides by that inverse. The equation would become n \u2261 72 * (100 inverse) mod 101. \n\nFirst, let me check if 100 and 101 are coprime. Since 101 is a prime number, any number less than 101 that isn't a multiple of 101 is coprime to it. 100 is less than 101 and not a multiple of 101, so gcd(100, 101) = 1. Therefore, the inverse of 100 modulo 101 exists. \n\nNow, I need to find the modular inverse of 100 mod 101. There are a couple of methods for this. One is the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. Let me try that. So, I need to find integers x and y such that 100x + 101y = 1. Then x will be the inverse of 100 modulo 101. \n\nLet me perform the Euclidean algorithm step by step. \n\n101 divided by 100 is 1 with a remainder of 1. So, 101 = 1*100 + 1. \n\nThen, 100 divided by 1 is 100 with a remainder of 0. So, the gcd is 1, which confirms they are coprime. \n\nNow, working backwards for Extended Euclidean:\n\n1 = 101 - 1*100. \n\nTherefore, x is -1 and y is 1. But since we want the inverse modulo 101, -1 mod 101 is 100. So the inverse of 100 mod 101 is 100. Let me verify that: 100*100 = 10000. Let's divide 10000 by 101. 101*99 = 9999, so 10000 - 9999 = 1. Therefore, 100*100 \u2261 1 mod 101. Yep, that checks out. \n\nSo, going back to the original equation: n \u2261 72 * 100 mod 101. Let's compute 72*100. 72*100 is 7200. Now divide 7200 by 101 to find the remainder. \n\nFirst, how many times does 101 go into 7200? Let's see. 101*70 = 7070. 7200 - 7070 = 130. Now 101*1 = 101. 130 - 101 = 29. So, 7200 divided by 101 is 71 with a remainder of 29. Therefore, 7200 \u2261 29 mod 101. \n\nTherefore, n \u2261 29 mod 101. Since n must be between 0 and 100, the solution is n = 29. \n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to be sure. \n\n1. Checked that 100 and 101 are coprime. Correct. 101 is prime, so yeah.\n\n2. Applied Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find inverse of 100 mod 101. Got x = -1, which is equivalent to 100 mod 101. Correct.\n\n3. Multiplied 72 by 100, which gave 7200. Divided by 101: 101*72 is 7272? Wait, wait, 100*72 is 7200, but 101*72 is 7272. Wait, no, 101*72: 100*72=7200, 1*72=72, so 7200+72=7272.

The options are line, circle, parabola, ellipse, or hyperbola. Let me start by understanding the parametric equations given here.\n\nFirst, let's note that both x and y are expressed in terms of 2^t. Maybe I can express y in terms of x to eliminate the parameter t. Let's see. \n\nLet me denote u = 2^t. Then, since 4^t is equal to (2^2)^t = 2^(2t) = (2^t)^2 = u^2. So substituting, x = u - 3 and y = u^2 - 5u - 1. \n\nSo if I write these equations:\n\nx = u - 3 => u = x + 3\n\nThen substitute u into the equation for y:\n\ny = (x + 3)^2 - 5(x + 3) - 1\n\nLet me expand that:\n\nFirst, expand (x + 3)^2: x^2 + 6x + 9\n\nThen subtract 5(x + 3): 5x + 15\n\nSo altogether:\n\ny = x^2 + 6x + 9 - 5x - 15 - 1\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx^2 + (6x - 5x) + (9 - 15 -1) = x^2 + x - 7\n\nTherefore, the equation simplifies to y = x^2 + x - 7.\n\nWait, that's a quadratic equation, which is a parabola. So the answer should be (C) Parabola. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with substitution: let u = 2^t, correct. Then x = u -3, y = u^2 -5u -1. So substituting u = x +3 into y. Expanding (x +3)^2 gives x\u00b2 +6x +9. Then subtract 5x and 15: 5x +15 = 5x +15. So y = x\u00b2 +6x +9 -5x -15 -1. Combine 6x -5x = x, 9 -15 -1 = -7. So y = x\u00b2 + x -7. Yep, that's a quadratic equation, which is a parabola. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nBut let me visualize this to make sure. If x = u -3, and u is 2^t, which is always positive. Therefore, x = u -3 must be greater than -3. So the curve exists only for x > -3. But the equation y = x\u00b2 + x -7 is a parabola opening upwards. So overlapping with x > -3. However, the equation itself, regardless of the domain restriction, is a parabola. So even if only a part of the parabola is traced, the entire curve for real t is a parabola. Therefore, the answer should be C.\n\nLet me check once more. If I substitute back into the original parametric equations, for each t, (x, y) is (2^t -3, 4^t -5*2^t -1). Then since y = (2^t)^2 -5*2^t -1, and 2^t is u, then as above, x = u -3, so u = x +3. Then y = (x +3)^2 -5(x +3) -1 = x\u00b2 +6x +9 -5x -15 -1 = x\u00b2 +x -7. So yes, the equation is a parabola. So the answer is C. I think that's correct.

The answer choices are a line, circle, parabola, ellipse, or hyperbola. Let me try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. For each real number t, we compute x as 2^t minus 3, and y as 4^t minus 5*2^t minus 1. Then, plotting all these (x, y) points, what's the shape of their trajectory? The options are curves like lines, circles, parabolas, ellipses, or hyperbolas. So, I need to eliminate the parameter t and find a relation between x and y.\n\nLet me start by expressing everything in terms of 2^t. Let's denote u = 2^t. Then, x = u - 3. So, we can write u = x + 3. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, let's express y in terms of u. The original expression for y is 4^t - 5*2^t - 1. Notice that 4^t is (2^t)^2 = u^2. So, substituting, y = u^2 - 5u - 1.\n\nSo now, we have x = u - 3 and y = u^2 - 5u - 1. If we substitute u from the first equation into the second, we can eliminate t and get a relation between x and y.\n\nSince u = x + 3, substitute this into the equation for y:\n\ny = (x + 3)^2 - 5(x + 3) - 1.\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, expand (x + 3)^2:\n\n(x + 3)^2 = x^2 + 6x + 9.\n\nThen, subtract 5(x + 3):\n\n-5(x + 3) = -5x - 15.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\ny = [x^2 + 6x + 9] + [-5x - 15] - 1.\n\nCombine the terms:\n\nx^2 + 6x + 9 - 5x - 15 - 1.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx^2 + (6x - 5x) + (9 - 15 - 1).\n\nSimplify:\n\nx^2 + x + (-7).\n\nTherefore, y = x^2 + x - 7.\n\nHmm, so this simplifies to y = x\u00b2 + x - 7. Let me check if I did the algebra correctly here.\n\nStarting again:\n\ny = (x + 3)^2 - 5(x + 3) - 1\n\nFirst, (x + 3)^2 = x\u00b2 + 6x + 9.\n\nThen, -5(x + 3) = -5x -15.\n\nSo, adding all terms:\n\nx\u00b2 + 6x + 9 -5x -15 -1\n\nCombine x terms: 6x -5x = x\n\nConstants: 9 -15 -1 = -7\n\nSo yes, y = x\u00b2 + x -7.

The options are from line to hyperbola, so I need to see if there's a relationship between x and y that can be expressed in a specific form. Let me start by breaking down the expressions for x and y.\n\nFirst, let's analyze each component step by step. The x-coordinate is given by x = 2^t - 3. Maybe if I can express 2^t in terms of x, that could help me substitute into the y-coordinate. Let's solve for 2^t:\n\nx = 2^t - 3  \n=> 2^t = x + 3\n\nOkay, so 2^t is x + 3. Now, let's look at the y-coordinate:  \ny = 4^t - 5*2^t - 1\n\nHmm, 4^t is the same as (2^2)^t, which is 2^(2t). That can be written as (2^t)^2. Since we already have 2^t in terms of x, maybe we can rewrite y in terms of x. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, substitute 2^t with (x + 3):\n\ny = (x + 3)^2 - 5*(x + 3) - 1\n\nWait, let me check that substitution again. Let's do it step by step to avoid mistakes.\n\nStarting with y:\n\ny = 4^t - 5*2^t - 1  \n= (2^(2t)) - 5*2^t - 1  \nBut since 2^(2t) = (2^t)^2, and we know 2^t = x + 3, then (2^t)^2 = (x + 3)^2  \nTherefore, substituting into y:\n\ny = (x + 3)^2 - 5*(x + 3) - 1\n\nGreat, so that's correct. Now, let's expand that expression to see if we can simplify into a quadratic form or something else.\n\nExpanding (x + 3)^2:  \n= x^2 + 6x + 9  \nThen subtract 5*(x + 3):  \n= x^2 + 6x + 9 - 5x - 15  \n= x^2 + (6x - 5x) + (9 - 15)  \n= x^2 + x - 6\n\nSo, putting it all together, y = x^2 + x - 6\n\nWait, so y is a quadratic function of x. Therefore, the relationship between x and y is quadratic, which means the curve is a parabola. But let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, starting with x = 2^t - 3, so 2^t = x + 3. Then y = 4^t -5*2^t -1. Expressing 4^t as (2^t)^2 gives (x + 3)^2 -5*(x + 3) -1. Expanding:\n\n(x + 3)^2 = x\u00b2 + 6x + 9  \nThen subtract 5*(x + 3) = 5x + 15  \nSo altogether: x\u00b2 +6x +9 -5x -15 -1  \n= x\u00b2 + (6x -5x) + (9 -15 -1)  \n= x\u00b2 + x -7\n\nWait, hold on, I think I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate the constants:\n\nOriginal expression after substitution:\n\n(x + 3)^2 -5*(x + 3) -1  \n= [x\u00b2 +6x +9] - [5x +15] -1  \n= x\u00b2 +6x +9 -5x -15 -1\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx\u00b2 + (6x -5x) + (9 -15 -1)  \n= x\u00b2 +x + (9 -16)  \n= x\u00b2 +x -7\n\nWait, so the last step is 9 -15 -1 = 9 -16 = -7. So y = x\u00b2 + x -7. Therefore, it's a quadratic equation in x, which confirms that it's a parabola. \n\nSo that would be answer choice (C) Parabola.

That means if I let s = 2^t, then x = s - 3. So s = x + 3. That's straightforward. Now, the y-coordinate is a bit more complex: y = 4^t - 5*2^t - 1. Since 4^t is the same as (2^t)^2, which is s^2. So substituting s in, y becomes s^2 - 5s - 1. \n\nSo now we have both x and y in terms of s. Let's write that down:\n\nx = s - 3 \u21d2 s = x + 3\n\ny = s\u00b2 - 5s - 1\n\nTherefore, substituting s from the first equation into the second equation:\n\ny = (x + 3)\u00b2 - 5(x + 3) - 1\n\nLet me expand this step by step. First, expand (x + 3)\u00b2:\n\n(x + 3)\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 6x + 9\n\nThen subtract 5(x + 3):\n\n5(x + 3) = 5x + 15, so subtracting that gives x\u00b2 + 6x + 9 - 5x - 15 - 1\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx\u00b2 + (6x - 5x) + (9 - 15 -1) = x\u00b2 + x - 7\n\nTherefore, y = x\u00b2 + x - 7\n\nWait, that's a quadratic equation in x. So y is a function of x squared. That should be a parabola. The general form of a parabola is either y = ax\u00b2 + bx + c or x = ay\u00b2 + by + c. Since we have y expressed in terms of x, this is a vertical parabola, which is a specific case of a conic section. So the answer should be (C) Parabola.\n\nBut let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with x = 2^t -3 \u21d2 s = 2^t = x +3. Then y = (2^t)^2 -5*2^t -1. Plugging s in, it's s\u00b2 -5s -1. Then substituting s = x +3 gives (x +3)^2 -5(x +3) -1. Expanding (x +3)^2: x\u00b2 +6x +9. Then subtract 5x +15: x\u00b2 +6x +9 -5x -15. That's x\u00b2 +x -6. Then subtract 1: x\u00b2 +x -7. So yes, y = x\u00b2 +x -7. That's a parabola. So the correct answer is C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check with another point. Let's pick t=0.

The options are Line, Circle, Parabola, Ellipse, or Hyperbola. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's denote the coordinates of the point. The x-coordinate is 2^t - 3, and the y-coordinate is 4^t - 5*2^t - 1. Hmm, 4^t is the same as (2^t)^2. Maybe if I express y in terms of x, I can eliminate t and see what the equation is.\n\nLet me set x = 2^t - 3. Then solving for 2^t gives 2^t = x + 3. Now, let's see how to express y in terms of x. The y-coordinate is 4^t - 5*2^t - 1. Since 4^t is (2^t)^2, substituting 2^t with x + 3 gives:\n\ny = (x + 3)^2 - 5*(x + 3) - 1.\n\nLet me expand that. First, expand (x + 3)^2: that's x^2 + 6x + 9.\n\nThen subtract 5*(x + 3): that's -5x -15.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\ny = (x^2 + 6x + 9) - 5x -15 -1.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx^2 + 6x -5x +9 -15 -1.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx^2 + x -7.\n\nSo the equation is y = x^2 + x -7. That's a quadratic equation in x, which means it's a parabola. Therefore, the points lie on a parabola. Let me verify this step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with x = 2^t - 3 => 2^t = x + 3. Then y = 4^t -5*2^t -1. Since 4^t is (2^t)^2, substitute 2^t with x + 3:\n\ny = (x + 3)^2 -5(x +3) -1.\n\nExpanding (x +3)^2: x^2 +6x +9. Then subtract 5(x +3): -5x -15. So y = x^2 +6x +9 -5x -15 -1.\n\nSimplify step by step:\n\nx^2 +6x -5x = x^2 +x.\n\n9 -15 is -6, then -6 -1 is -7. So y = x^2 +x -7. Yes, that's right. So the equation is y = x^2 +x -7, which is a parabola opening upwards.\n\nLooking back at the answer choices, (C) Parabola is the correct answer. Let me just check if I considered all possibilities. The other options are Line, Circle, Ellipse, Hyperbola. The line would be if it's linear, which it's not. Circle would require a quadratic term with both x^2 and y^2, but here both sides are in terms of x only. Similarly, hyperbola would also require a x^2 and y^2 term, but here y is expressed in terms of x. Ellipse usually has terms like x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 =1, but again, since it's a quadratic in y expressed via x, this is just a parabola.

Hmm, logarithms can be tricky at first, but if I break it down, maybe it will make more sense.\n\nFirst, I remember that logarithms are about finding the exponent you need on a certain base to get another number. So, the expression log\u208464 is asking: \"What exponent do I need to raise 4 to, in order to get 64?\" So, in mathematical terms, I need to find x such that 4^x = 64.\n\nLet me write that down clearly: 4^x = 64. Now, I need to solve for x. Let me see if I can express 64 as a power of 4. Let me recall the powers of 4:\n\n4^1 = 4\n\n4^2 = 16\n\n4^3 = 64\n\nOh, wait! 4 cubed is 64. So that means x must be 3. Therefore, log\u208464 = 3.\n\nBut let me verify that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If I plug 3 back into the original equation: 4^3 = 64, which is correct because 4*4=16, then 16*4=64. Yep, that checks out. So the answer should be 3.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check using another method to be sure. Maybe using the change of base formula? The change of base formula says that log_b a = log_c a / log_c b. If I use base 10, that would be log64 / log4. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, log10(64) is log(64) which is approximately 1.80618, and log10(4) is approximately 0.60206. Then, dividing those gives 1.80618 / 0.60206 \u2248 3. So that also gives me 3. That confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use natural logarithms (ln). So ln64 / ln4. Let me check that. ln64 is approximately 4.1589, and ln4 is approximately 1.3863. Dividing those gives 4.1589 / 1.3863 \u2248 3.0. So again, the same result.\n\nTherefore, all methods confirm that log\u208464 is indeed 3. I think that's solid.

So, log base 4 of 64 is asking the question: \"4 raised to what power equals 64?\" Let me write that down to make it clearer.\n\nSo, $\\log_4 64 = x$ implies that $4^x = 64$. Now, I need to find x such that 4 to the power of x is 64. Let me recall the powers of 4. I know that 4 squared is 16, 4 cubed is 64. Wait, hold on, 4 squared is 16, because 4 times 4 is 16. Then 4 cubed would be 4 times 16, which is 64. Yes, that's right. So, 4 multiplied by itself three times gives 64. Therefore, x must be 3. Let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nIf I plug x = 3 back into the original equation, $4^3 = 64. Yes, 4*4=16, 16*4=64. Perfect, that's correct. So, the logarithm log base 4 of 64 is indeed 3. \n\nJust to double-check, I can think in terms of prime factors. Let's factorize 4 and 64. The prime factorization of 4 is 2 squared (2\u00b2), and 64 is 2 to the sixth power (2\u2076). So, rewriting the equation in terms of base 2, we have log base 4 of 64 is equal to log base 2\u00b2 of 2\u2076. Using the change of base formula, which states that log_{a^b} c^d} = d/b * log_a c. In this case, log base 2\u00b2 of 2\u2076 would be (6/2) * log base 2 of 2. Since log base 2 of 2 is 1, this simplifies to (6/2)*1 = 3.

So, log base 4 of 64 is asking the question: \"4 raised to what power gives me 64?\" In symbols, that would be 4^x = 64. If I can find the value of x that satisfies this equation, then that x is the value of the logarithm. \n\nLet me check that understanding. If log_4(64) = x, then 4^x = 64. Yes, that seems right. Now, I need to solve for x here. \n\nI know that 4 is a base of a power function, and 64 is a power of 4 as well. Let me factorize both numbers to see the relationship. Starting with 4: 4 is 2 squared, so 4 = 2^2. Then 64 is a well-known power of 2. Let me verify: 2^6 is 64, because 2^5 is 32 and 2^6 is 64. So 64 = 2^6. \n\nNow, I can substitute these expressions back into the equation. Since 4 is 2^2 and 64 is 2^6, the equation becomes:\n\n(2^2)^x = 2^6\n\nUsing the power of a power rule, which states that (a^m)^n = a^(m*n), this simplifies to:\n\n2^(2x) = 2^6\n\nSince the bases are the same (both are base 2), the exponents must be equal. Therefore:\n\n2x = 6\n\nSolving for x, divide both sides by 2:\n\nx = 6 / 2\n\nx = 3\n\nSo, log base 4 of 64 is 3. Let me double-check this to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If I plug 4^3 back into the equation, is that equal to 64?\n\n4^3 is 4*4*4. 4*4 is 16, and 16*4 is 64. Yes, that's correct. So the logarithm is indeed 3. \n\nWait, let me try another approach just to confirm. Maybe converting the logarithm to natural logarithms using the change of base formula. The formula is log_b(a) = ln(a)/ln(b). Applying that here:\n\nlog_4(64) = ln(64)/ln(4)\n\nCalculating both natural logs:\n\nln(64) is ln(2^6) = 6*ln(2)\n\nln(4) is ln(2^2) = 2*ln(2)\n\nTherefore, ln(64)/ln(4) = (6*ln(2))/(2*ln(2)) = 6/2 = 3\n\nSame result! So that's consistent. \n\nJust to be thorough, let me check if there's any alternative method, like using exponents step by step. Starting with 4^1 = 4, 4^2 = 16, 4^3 = 64. Yep, that's three steps. So each time I multiply by 4, and after three multiplications, I reach 64.

Hmm, let me think. First, I remember that logarithms and exponents are inverses of each other. So, if I have log base a of b, it means I'm looking for the exponent x such that a raised to x equals b. So in this case, log base 4 of 64 is asking: 4 to the power of what equals 64? \n\nLet me write that out. Let x be log_4(64). Then, 4^x = 64. My goal is to find x. \n\nNow, maybe I can express 64 as a power of 4. If I can write 64 as 4 raised to some exponent, then comparing the exponents would give me the answer. Let's see. 4 times 4 is 16. 4 times 4 times 4 is 64. Wait, that would be 4^3 because 4*4=16 and 16*4=64. Let me check: 4^1=4, 4^2=16, 4^3=64. Yes, that's right! So 4^3 is 64. Therefore, if 4^x = 64, then x must be 3. \n\nSo, log_4(64) equals 3. Let me verify this using another method to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to check is using the change of base formula. The change of base formula says that log_b(a) = log_c(a)/log_c(b) for any positive number c not equal to 1. If I use base 2, since 4 is 2 squared, that might be helpful. Let's try that. \n\nUsing base 2: log_4(64) = log_2(64)/log_2(4). I know that log_2(64) is 6 because 2^6=64.

Let me think about how to approach this. Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember there are a few formulas to convert between different bases or express logs in terms of exponents. Let me recall... \n\nFirst, the definition of a logarithm. The logarithm of a number x with base b is the exponent you need to raise b to in order to get x. In mathematical terms, if $\\log_b a = c$, then $b^c = a$. So in this case, $\\log_4 64 = c$ means that $4^c = 64$. My goal is to find the value of c that satisfies this equation.\n\nLet me check if I can express 64 as a power of 4. I know that 4 squared is 16, 4 cubed is 64. Let me verify that: 4 times 4 is 16, then 16 times 4 is 64. Yes, so 4 cubed equals 64. Therefore, c must be 3. So $\\log_4 64 = 3$.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me verify using another method. Maybe using the change of base formula? The change of base formula says that $\\log_b a = \\frac{\\log_c a}{\\log_c b}$ for any positive number c not equal to 1. Let me apply that here with base 10.\n\nSo, $\\log_4 64 = \\frac{\\log_{10} 64}{\\log_{10} 4}$. Let me calculate these values. Hmm, log base 10 of 64. Well, 10^2 is 100, so log 100 is 2, and log 64 is a bit less. Let me recall that 64 is 2^6, and since 2^6 = 64, and 10^0.792 \u2248 6. So log10(64) \u2248 1.806. Then log10(4) is log10(2^2) = 2 log10(2) \u2248 2 * 0.3010 = 0.6020. Then dividing 1.806 by 0.6020 gives approximately 3. So that checks out. Therefore, the answer is 3.\n\nAlternatively, I can use natural logarithms: ln(64)/ln(4). ln(64) is ln(2^6) = 6 ln(2), and ln(4) is ln(2^2) = 2 ln(2). So the ratio is 6 ln(2) / 2 ln(2) = 3. Yep, same result. So that confirms it again.\n\nAnother way to check is to use the original exponentiation equation: 4^3 = 64. 4*4=16, 16*4=64. Correct. Therefore, the logarithm is indeed 3.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I used the definition of logarithms, verified with different methods, and cross-checked the results. So I can be confident that the answer is 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of $\\log_4 64$ is \\boxed{3}.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate \\(\\log_4 64\\), we start by converting the logarithmic expression to its exponential form. The definition of a logarithm tells us that \\(\\log_4 64 = c\\) means \\(4^c = 64\\). \n\nWe need to find the exponent \\(c\\) such that \\(4\\) raised to that power equals \\(64\\). \n\nFirst, express \\(64\\) as a power of \\(4\\):\n\\[\n4^3 = 64\n\\]\nSince \\(4^3 = 64\\), it follows that \\(c = 3\\). Therefore, \\(\\log_4 64 = 3\\).\n\nTo verify, we can use the change of base formula with base 10:\n\\[\n\\log_4 64 = \\frac{\\log_{10} 64}{\\log_{10} 4}\n\\]\nWe know that \\(64 = 2^6\\) and \\(4 = 2^2\\).

Let me start by recalling what a logarithm actually means. A logarithm is essentially asking, \"To what exponent do I raise the base to get the number?\" So, in this case, the question is: \"What power do I need to raise 4 to in order to get 64?\" \n\nLet me write that down step by step to make sure I'm on the right track. The logarithm expression here is log base 4 of 64, which translates to:\n\n\\( \\log_4 64 = x \\)\n\nThis means that:\n\n\\( 4^x = 64 \\)\n\nNow, I need to find the value of x that satisfies this equation. Let me think about the powers of 4. I know that 4 to the first power is 4, 4 squared is 16, 4 cubed is 64. Wait, let me verify that again to be sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n- 4^1 = 4\n- 4^2 = 4 * 4 = 16\n- 4^3 = 16 * 4 = 64\n\nYes, that checks out. So 4 cubed (4^3) equals 64. Therefore, x must be 3. That means log base 4 of 64 is 3. \n\nBut just to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake, let me double-check. Let me convert the logarithmic equation back to its exponential form. If \\( \\log_4 64 = 3 \\), then \\( 4^3 = 64 \\) should hold true. Since 4*4 is 16 and 16*4 is 64, this is correct. \n\nAlternatively, I could also use the change of base formula to confirm. The change of base formula states that:\n\n\\( \\log_b a = \\frac{\\log_c a}{\\log_c b} \\)\n\nwhere c is a new base, typically 10 or e, which I prefer because I know them well. Let me use base 10 for this:\n\n\\( \\log_4 64 = \\frac{\\log_{10} 64}{\\log_{10} 4} \\)\n\nCalculating the values:\n\nFirst, log base 10 of 64. I know that 10^1 = 10, 10^2 = 100. So 64 is between 10^1 and 10^2. Specifically, 64 is 10^(log10(64)), which I can compute using a calculator. But maybe I can do this mentally. \n\nWait, 64 is 6.4 * 10^1, but that might not help. Alternatively, I can use exponents of 10 that relate to 64. Alternatively, perhaps I can leave this as log10(64)/log10(4) and simplify further. Let me see.\n\nBut 64 is 4^3, so log10(64) = log10(4^3) = 3 log10(4). Therefore, substituting back into the change of base formula:\n\n\\( \\frac{\\log_{10} 64}{\\log_{10} 4} = \\frac{3 \\log_{10} 4}{\\log_{10} 4} = 3 \\)\n\nSo that cancels out the log10(4) terms, leaving just 3. Therefore, confirming that the original log is indeed 3. \n\nThis cross-verification using the change of base formula gives me the same answer, which makes me confident that my initial calculation was correct. \n\nAnother way to check is to use natural logarithm (base e) for the change of base formula:\n\n\\( \\log_4 64 = \\frac{\\ln 64}{\\ln 4} \\)\n\nCalculating ln 64 and ln 4. Since 64 is 4^3, ln 64 = ln(4^3) = 3 ln 4. Therefore, the ratio becomes:\n\n\\( \\frac{3 \\ln 4}{\\ln 4} = 3 \\)\n\nSo that also confirms the answer. \n\nTherefore, through multiple methods\u2014direct calculation, change of base formula with base 10, and change of base formula with natural logarithm\u2014the result is consistent. Each time, the answer is 3. \n\nThus, the value of log base 4 of 64 is 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of $\\log_4 64", 0.5600000023841858], ["35", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Let me think. Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but maybe I can break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that a logarithm is an exponent. Specifically, log_b(a) asks the question: \"To what power do I need to raise the base b to get the number a?\" So in this case, log base 4 of 64 is asking: \"What exponent do I need to raise 4 to in order to get 64?\" \n\nLet me write that down: 4^x = 64. Now, I need to solve for x. \n\nI know that 4 squared is 16, 4 cubed is 64. Let me check that. 4 squared is 4*4=16, then 16*4=64. So 4^3=64. Therefore, x must be 3. So log base 4 of 64 is 3. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't skip a step. Is there another way to verify this? I can also use the change of base formula if I don't recognize the exponents immediately, but that might be overcomplicating. Let me verify using natural logarithms or common logarithms. \n\nUsing the change of base formula: log_b(a) = ln(a)/ln(b). So log_4(64) = ln(64)/ln(4). Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, ln(64). 64 is 2^6, so ln(2^6) = 6 ln(2) \u2248 6*0.6931 \u2248 4.1589. \n\nln(4) is ln(2^2) = 2 ln(2) \u2248 2*0.6931 \u2248 1.3862. \n\nSo dividing them: 4.1589 / 1.3862 \u2248 3.0. Exactly 3.0. So that checks out. \n\nAlternatively, using common logarithms (base 10): log_4(64) = log10(64)/log10(4). Let's compute that. \n\nlog10(64): 64 is 10^(1.806) approximately? Wait, 10^1=10, 10^2=100. 64 is between them. Let me calculate log10(64). Since 10^1.8 \u2248 63.9? Wait, 10^1.8 is 10^(1 + 0.8) = 10 * 10^0.8. 10^0.8 is approximately 6.30957, so 10 * 6.30957 \u2248 63.0957. Hmm, that's pretty close to 64. So log10(64) \u2248 1.806. \n\nlog10(4) is log10(10^(0.6020)) \u2248 0.6020. So dividing 1.806 / 0.6020 \u2248 3.0. That also gives 3.0. So multiple methods confirm that the answer is 3. \n\nHmm, but let me try solving it without a calculator to make sure. Since 4 is 2 squared, maybe I can express 64 in terms of base 2. \n\n64 is 2^6. And 4 is 2^2. So log_4(64) can be rewritten using the change of base formula to base 2. \n\nlog_4(64) = log_2(64)/log_2(4) = 6 / 2 = 3. \n\nAh, that's a good way! Since 64 is 2^6 and 4 is 2^2, so the logarithm base 2 of 64 is 6, divided by the logarithm base 2 of 4, which is 2, gives 3. So all methods converge to the answer 3. \n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the value of log base 4 of 64 is 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of $\\log_4 64$ is \\boxed{3}.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate \\(\\log_4 64\\), we need to determine the exponent to which the base 4 must be raised to obtain 64. \n\nFirst, we recognize that this is equivalent to solving", 1.5], ["35", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

The question is: How many positive three-digit integers with each digit greater than 4 are divisible by 6? Hmm, let's start by understanding what exactly is being asked here.\n\nFirst, a three-digit integer with each digit greater than 4. That means each digit (hundreds, tens, and ones place) has to be 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. So there are 5 choices for each digit. Since the digits are independent of each other, right? So normally, there would be 5 * 5 * 5 = 125 possible numbers. But that's all three-digit numbers with each digit greater than 4. But the problem also says these numbers must be divisible by 6. So we have to narrow down those 125 numbers to only those divisible by 6. Alright, so my task is to find how many such numbers meet both criteria.\n\nLet me recall the divisibility rules for 6. A number is divisible by 6 if and only if it's divisible by both 2 and 3. So the number has to satisfy two conditions: divisibility by 2 and divisibility by 3. Let me check each condition one by one.\n\nFirst, divisibility by 2: A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even. The digits allowed are 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Out of these, the even digits are 6 and 8. So the ones place can only be 6 or 8. So that gives 2 choices for the ones digit. Therefore, if a number is divisible by 6, its last digit must be 6 or 8. That's the divisibility by 2 part.\n\nNext, divisibility by 3: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. So the sum of the hundreds digit, tens digit, and ones digit must be a multiple of 3. Let's note that the hundreds and tens digits can be 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, and the ones digit can be 6 or 8.\n\nSo putting this together, we need to count all three-digit numbers with digits from {5,6,7,8,9} where the ones digit is either 6 or 8, and the sum of all three digits is divisible by 3.\n\nThis seems like a problem that might require some combinatorial counting with constraints. Let me structure my approach.\n\nFirst, let's handle the ones digit because it has the most restrictive condition (only 6 or 8). Let me denote the digits as H (hundreds), T (tens), O (ones). So O \u2208 {6,8}, H \u2208 {5,6,7,8,9}, T \u2208 {5,6,7,8,9}.\n\nWe need to find all triplets (H, T, O) such that:\n\n1. O \u2208 {6,8}\n2. H + T + O \u2261 0 mod 3\n3. H, T, O are each digits from their respective sets.\n\nSo, since O is fixed as 6 or 8, let's split this into two cases: O=6 and O=8. Then, for each case, we can compute the number of H and T that satisfy the congruence condition.\n\nTherefore, total numbers = number of H and T with O=6 and H+T+6 \u22610 mod3 + number of H and T with O=8 and H+T+8 \u22610 mod3.\n\nSo, let's compute each part separately.\n\nFirst, let's handle O=6. Then the sum H + T + 6 must be divisible by 3. So H + T \u2261 (-6) mod3. But since -6 mod3 is equivalent to 0 mod3 (because -6 divided by 3 is -2, which is an integer). So H + T \u22610 mod3.\n\nSimilarly, for O=8, the sum H + T +8 \u22610 mod3. So H + T \u2261 (-8) mod3. Let's compute -8 mod3. 8 divided by 3 is 2 with remainder 2, so 8 \u22612 mod3. Therefore, -8 \u2261 -2 \u22611 mod3. So H + T \u22611 mod3.\n\nTherefore, for O=6, we need H + T \u22610 mod3, and for O=8, H + T \u22611 mod3.\n\nNow, our task reduces to finding how many pairs (H, T) exist such that H + T \u22610 mod3 when O=6, and H + T\u22611 mod3 when O=8", 0.38999998569488525], ["35", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's confirm what it means for a number to be divisible by 6. A number is divisible by 6 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 3. Divisibility by 2 means the last digit must be even, right? And divisibility by 3 means the sum of the digits must be a multiple of 3. Got that.\n\nNow, the problem specifies that each digit must be greater than 4. So, digits can't be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. That leaves the digits 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Wait, no, actually, each digit has to be greater than 4, so digits allowed are 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So, each of the hundreds, tens, and units places can be 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. That gives 5 choices for each digit. But we have to ensure the number is divisible by 6.\n\nLet me tackle this step by step.\n\nFirst, determine the total number of three-digit numbers with all digits greater than 4. Since each digit (hundreds, tens, units) can be 5,6,7,8,9, the total numbers are 5 * 5 * 5 = 125. But we need to count only those divisible by 6. So, out of these 125 numbers, how many satisfy both divisibility by 2 and 3?\n\nLet me split this into two parts: numbers divisible by 2 and numbers divisible by 3, then use the principle of inclusion-exclusion, but maybe it's easier to check for both conditions together.\n\nFirst, let's find numbers divisible by 2 (i.e., ending with even digits) with all digits >4.\n\nPossible digits for the units place (to be even and greater than 4): 6,8. So, there are 2 choices for the units digit.\n\nThen, the hundreds and tens digits can still be any of 5,6,7,8,9. So, hundreds: 5 choices, tens: 5 choices, units: 2 choices. So total numbers divisible by 2: 5 * 5 * 2 = 50.\n\nNow, from these 50 numbers, how many are also divisible by 3?\n\nTo check divisibility by 3, the sum of the digits must be a multiple of 3. Let's denote the digits as A (hundreds), B (tens), C (units). Each of A, B can be 5,6,7,8,9; C must be 6 or 8.\n\nSo, the sum A + B + C must be divisible by 3.\n\nSo, let's model this.\n\nFirst, find all possible combinations of A, B, C where A, B \u2208 {5,6,7,8,9}, C \u2208 {6,8}, and A + B + C \u2261 0 mod 3.\n\nThis seems a bit complex, but maybe we can compute the number of valid triples.\n\nAlternatively, since we can compute the total number of triples and then adjust for the divisibility by 3.\n\nBut since the hundreds and tens digits affect the sum regardless of the units digit, perhaps we can fix C first and then compute the number of A and B that satisfy the sum condition modulo 3.\n\nLet me try this approach.\n\nCase 1: C = 6.\n\nThen, A + B + 6 \u2261 0 mod 3 \u21d2 A + B \u2261 0 mod 3.\n\nCase 2: C = 8.\n\nThen, A + B + 8 \u2261 0 mod 3 \u21d2 A + B \u2261 1 mod 3.\n\nSo, for each case, we need the number of pairs (A,B) such that A + B \u2261 0 mod 3 (if C=6) or A + B \u2261 1 mod 3 (if C=8).\n\nFirst, let's compute the number of pairs (A,B) where A and B are each in {5,6,7,8,9} and their sum is congruent to 0 or 1 mod 3.\n\nLet me note that the digits A and B can be 5,6,7,8,9. Let's map them to their residues mod 3:\n\n5: 5 mod 3 = 2\n\n6: 6 mod 3 = 0\n\n7: 7 mod 3 = 1\n\n8: 8 mod 3 = 2\n\n9: 9", 0.5299999713897705], ["35", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

The question is asking how many positive three-digit integers have each digit greater than 4 and are divisible by 6. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down into smaller parts to make it easier.\n\nFirst, let's understand the requirements. The number must be a three-digit integer. Each digit must be greater than 4. Divisible by 6. So, to be divisible by 6, the number has to be divisible by both 2 and 3. Let me recall the divisibility rules for 2 and 3.\n\nFor a number to be divisible by 2, it needs to be even. That means the last digit must be even. Since each digit is greater than 4, possible digits are 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. But wait, the last digit must be even, so only 6 and 8. So the units place can only be 6 or 8. That cuts down our possibilities for the units digit.\n\nFor divisibility by 3, the sum of the digits must be a multiple of 3. So, the sum of the hundreds, tens, and units digits needs to be divisible by 3.\n\nSo, let's approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, let's list out all possible three-digit numbers where each digit is 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. Then, filter those numbers that are divisible by 6.\n\nBut that seems tedious because there are 5 options for each digit, so 5*5*5 = 125 total numbers, which is manageable, but maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, since the unit digit must be 6 or 8, we can split into two cases: numbers ending with 6 and numbers ending with 8. Then, check the sum of digits for each case to see if it's divisible by 3.\n\nLet me try this approach.\n\nCase 1: Numbers ending with 6.\n\nIn this case, the hundreds and tens digits can be 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, and the units digit is 6.\n\nSo, hundreds digit: 5 choices (5,6,7,8,9)\n\nTens digit: 5 choices\n\nUnits digit: 1 choice (6)\n\nSo, total numbers in this case: 5 * 5 * 1 = 25.\n\nNow, we need the sum of the digits (hundreds + tens + 6) to be divisible by 3.\n\nLet me denote H for hundreds digit, T for tens digit, U for units digit. So, H + T + U must be divisible by 3. Since U is 6, we need H + T + 6 \u2261 0 mod 3, which means H + T \u2261 -6 mod 3. But since -6 mod 3 is 0 (because -6 is a multiple of 3), we need H + T \u2261 0 mod 3.\n\nTherefore, in the case where the unit digit is 6, the sum of hundreds and tens digits must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo, how many pairs (H, T) have H + T \u2261 0 mod 3?\n\nEach H and T can be 5,6,7,8,9. Let's note the residues modulo 3:\n\nNumbers greater than 4: 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nLet me map them to their residues mod 3:\n\n5 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2 (5 \u2261 2 mod 3)\n\n6 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 0 (6 \u2261 0 mod 3)\n\n7 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1 (7 \u2261 1 mod 3)\n\n8 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2 (8 \u2261 2 mod 3)\n\n9 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 0 (9 \u2261 0 mod 3)\n\nSo, possible residues for H and T are: 0,1,2. Each number corresponds to 0,1,2 mod 3 as follows:\n\nH and T can be:\n\n- Residue 0: 6,9 (two numbers)\n- Residue 1: 7 (one number)\n- Residue 2: 5,8 (two numbers)\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\n5 \u2261 2, 6 \u2261 0, 7 \u2261 1, 8 \u2261 2, 9 \u2261 0. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, residues:\n\n0: 6,9 (two numbers)\n1:7 (one number)\n2:5,8 (two numbers)\n\nWe need H + T \u2261 0 mod 3.\n\nSo, possible combinations:\n\nEither both H and T", 0.4300000071525574], ["35", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

The question is asking for the number of positive three-digit integers where each digit is greater than 4, and the number itself must be divisible by 6. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, let's recall the conditions:\n\n1. **Three-digit number**: So numbers from 100 to 999.\n2. **Each digit greater than 4**: That means each digit must be 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. Because those are the digits greater than 4.\n3. **Divisible by 6**: Divisibility by 6 means the number must be divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\nAlright, so I need to check two things for each three-digit number with digits 5-9: first, whether it's divisible by 2, and second, whether it's divisible by 3. But maybe instead of checking each number individually, I can approach this systematically by considering the divisibility rules and constraints on the digits.\n\nLet me start by handling the divisibility by 2. For a number to be divisible by 2, its last digit must be even. So, the units digit (the third digit) has to be even. The digits allowed are 5-9, so the even digits in that range are 6 and 8. So, the units digit can be 6 or 8. That gives us 2 choices for the units digit.\n\nNext, divisibility by 3. The rule for 3 is that the sum of the digits must be divisible by 3. So, if I can find all possible three-digit numbers with digits from 5-9, where the last digit is either 6 or 8 (as per divisibility by 2), and the sum of all three digits is divisible by 3, then that number is divisible by 6.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of three-digit numbers with digits 5,6,7,8,9 repeated, where the units digit is 6 or 8, and the sum of the digits is divisible by 3.\n\nLet me structure this step by step:\n\n1. **Determine possible digits for each place:**\n   - Hundreds place: can be 5,6,7,8,9 (5 choices)\n   - Tens place: same, 5 choices\n   - Units place: 6 or 8 (2 choices)\n\n2. **For each possible combination of hundreds, tens, and units digits, check if the sum is divisible by 3.**\n\nBut checking all possible combinations would take a lot of time since there are 5*5*2 = 50 numbers. However, maybe we can find a smarter way using modular arithmetic.\n\nLet me recall that if a number N is divisible by 3, then the sum of its digits S is congruent to 0 modulo 3. So, S \u2261 0 mod 3.\n\nGiven that the digits are 5,6,7,8,9. Let's first note their residues modulo 3:\n\n- 5 mod 3 = 2\n- 6 mod 3 = 0\n- 7 mod 3 = 1\n- 8 mod 3 = 2\n- 9 mod 3 = 0\n\nSo, digits can be categorized as follows:\n\n- Residue 0: 6,9\n- Residue 1:7\n- Residue 2:5,8\n\nTherefore, when constructing the three-digit number, each digit contributes a certain residue to the total sum. We need the total sum to be congruent to 0 modulo 3.\n\nSo, let's denote:\n\n- Let h be the hundreds digit (residue: 2,0,1,2,0)\n- Let t be the tens digit (residue same as above)\n- Let u be the units digit (residue:0,0,1,2,0)\n\nWait, actually, let's clarify the residues properly:\n\nDigits allowed (5,6,7,8,9) have residues as per their modulo 3:\n\n- 5: 2\n- 6: 0\n- 7:1\n- 8:2\n- 9:0\n\nTherefore, residues:\n\n- 0:6,9\n-1:7\n-2:5,8\n\nSo, for each digit position:\n\n- Hundreds place (h): 5 choices (digits 5-9), residues 2,0,1,2,0\n- Tens place (t): same 5 choices\n- Units place (u): 2 choices (6,8), residues 0,2\n\nWait, units place only has two digits:6 and8. 6 is 0 mod3 and 8 is 2 mod", 0.47999998927116394], ["35", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

The question is asking how many positive three-digit integers have each digit greater than 4 and are divisible by 6. Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, three-digit integers. So the numbers range from 100 to 999. But there's a condition: each digit must be greater than 4. That means each digit can only be 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. Let me confirm that. If each digit is greater than 4, then yes, 5,6,7,8,9 are the possible digits for each place (hundreds, tens, ones). So each digit has 5 choices. However, we need numbers divisible by 6. \n\nDivisibility by 6 means the number must be divisible by both 2 and 3. So, the number has to satisfy two conditions:\n\n1. Divisible by 2: The last digit (ones place) must be even.\n2. Divisible by 3: The sum of its digits must be a multiple of 3.\n\nLet me handle these one by one.\n\nFirst, for divisibility by 2: The last digit must be even. But looking at the digits allowed (5,6,7,8,9), the even ones are 6 and 8. So the ones place can only be 6 or 8. That gives us two choices for the ones digit.\n\nNow, for divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits must be divisible by 3. Since each digit can be 5,6,7,8,9, the hundreds digit (hundreds place), tens digit (tens place), and ones digit (ones place) each have these values. Let's think about how to calculate the sum modulo 3.\n\nSince numbers are modulo 3, we can reduce each digit modulo 3 first. Let's see:\n\n- 5 mod 3 = 2\n- 6 mod 3 = 0\n- 7 mod 3 = 1\n- 8 mod 3 = 2\n- 9 mod 3 = 0\n\nSo, each digit can be represented as:\n\n- 5 \u2192 2\n- 6 \u2192 0\n- 7 \u2192 1\n- 8 \u2192 2\n- 9 \u2192 0\n\nTherefore, the sum of the digits modulo 3 will be the sum of each digit modulo 3. Our task is to find three digits (hundreds, tens, ones) such that the sum of their residues modulo 3 is 0, and the ones digit is either 6 or 8 (which are 0 or 2 modulo 3).\n\nWait, but since the ones digit is already restricted to 6 or 8, let's first handle the ones digit and then see how the hundreds and tens digits can combine with them to make the total sum divisible by 3.\n\nLet me structure this as follows:\n\nCase 1: Ones digit is 6 (which is 0 mod 3)\nCase 2: Ones digit is 8 (which is 2 mod 3)\n\nIn each case, the sum of the hundreds, tens, and ones digits must be 0 mod 3. Let's analyze each case separately.\n\nStarting with Case 1: Ones digit is 6 (0 mod 3). Then the sum of hundreds and tens digits must be 0 mod 3.\n\nEach hundreds and tens digit can be 5,6,7,8,9, which correspond to residues 2,0,1,2,0 respectively.\n\nSo, for the hundreds and tens digits, each can contribute a residue of 0,1,2. Let's denote:\n\nh for hundreds digit residue: 0,1,2 (since 5\u21922,6\u21920,7\u21921,8\u21922,9\u21920)\nt for tens digit residue: same as above.\n\nWe need h + t \u2261 0 mod 3.\n\nSo, possible pairs (h,t) where h + t \u22610 mod3.\n\nLet's list all possible h and t residues:\n\nh can be 0,1,2\n\nt can be 0,1,2\n\nWe need h + t \u22610 mod3. Let's find all possible (h,t):\n\n- (0,0): 0+0=0\u22610 mod3\n- (1,2): 1+2=3\u22610 mod3\n- (2,1): 2+1=3\u22610 mod3\n\nSo these are the required pairs. Now, how many hundreds and tens digit combinations correspond to these residue pairs?\n\nFirst, let's find how many hundreds digits correspond to each residue:\n\n- Residue 0: digits 6,9 \u2192 2 choices\n- Residue 1: digit", 0.44999998807907104], ["35", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

The question is asking: How many positive three-digit integers with each digit greater than 4 are divisible by 6?\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We need to find three-digit numbers where all digits are greater than 4 (so digits can be 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9). Then, out of these numbers, we need to count how many are divisible by 6. \n\nAlright, let's break this down into parts. First, I should figure out how many three-digit numbers have all digits greater than 4. Then, among those, determine which ones are divisible by 6. \n\nStarting with the first part: three-digit numbers with each digit greater than 4. Since each digit must be greater than 4, the possible digits for each of the hundreds, tens, and units places are 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. That's 5 choices for each digit. Since the number is three digits, the total number of such numbers is 5 * 5 * 5 = 125. Let me confirm that: hundreds place can be 5-9 (5 options), tens place 5-9 (another 5), units place 5-9 (another 5). So yes, 5^3 = 125. \n\nSo there are 125 numbers to consider. Now, the problem is to find how many of these 125 are divisible by 6. \n\nDivisible by 6 means the number must be divisible by both 2 and 3. Divisibility by 2 requires that the units digit is even. Divisibility by 3 requires that the sum of the digits is a multiple of 3. \n\nSo, to solve this, I need to find all three-digit numbers composed of digits 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, which have an even units digit (to satisfy divisibility by 2) and the sum of digits is divisible by 3 (to satisfy divisibility by 3). \n\nLet me structure this:\n\n1. Determine how many numbers have an even units digit. Since digits are 5,6,7,8,9, the even digits are 6 and 8. So the units digit can be 6 or 8. So there are 2 choices for the units digit.\n\n2. For the hundreds and tens digits, each can be any of 5 digits (5,6,7,8,9). So after choosing the units digit (2 choices), the other two digits have 5 options each. So total numbers with even units digit would be 5 * 5 * 2 = 50. Wait, but hold on. Let me check that again. Hundreds digit: 5 options, tens digit: 5 options, units digit: 2 options. So 5*5*2=50. So there are 50 numbers where the units digit is even and the other digits are from 5,6,7,8,9. \n\nSo now, among these 50 numbers, how many have a digit sum divisible by 3? Because if the sum of the digits is divisible by 3, then the number is divisible by 3, and since it's already even (so divisible by 2), it will be divisible by 6. \n\nTherefore, the key now is to compute how many of these 50 numbers have a digit sum divisible by 3. \n\nTo approach this, perhaps we can consider all possible combinations of hundreds and tens digits (each from 5,6,7,8,9), with units digits fixed as 6 or 8, and check which of these combinations result in a digit sum divisible by 3. \n\nBut since hundreds, tens, and units digits are all from 5,6,7,8,9, but units digit is fixed (6 or 8), let's handle this step by step. \n\nFirst, let's consider the units digit as 6. Then, the sum of the hundreds and tens digits plus 6 must be divisible by 3. Similarly, if units digit is 8, the sum of the hundreds and tens digits plus 8 must be divisible by 3. \n\nTherefore, for units digit 6: total sum = (hundreds digit + tens digit + 6) \u2261 0 mod 3 \u2192 hundreds digit + tens digit \u2261 (-6) mod 3 \u2192 since -6 mod 3 is 0 (because 6 is 0 mod 3), so hundreds digit + tens digit \u2261 0 mod 3. \n\nFor units digit 8: total sum = (hundreds digit + tens digit + 8) \u2261 0 mod 3 \u2192 hundreds digit + tens digit", 0.5], ["35", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

The question is asking for the number of positive three-digit integers where each digit is greater than 4, and the number is divisible by 6. Hmm, let's break this down. \n\nFirst, numbers divisible by 6 must be divisible by both 2 and 3. So, to solve this, I need to ensure the number meets the criteria for divisibility by 2 and 3. Let me recall those rules.\n\nDivisibility by 2: The number must be even, which means its last digit has to be even.\nDivisibility by 3: The sum of its digits must be a multiple of 3.\n\nNow, since each digit has to be greater than 4, the digits can only be 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. Let's note that down\u2014digits allowed are 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So each digit has 5 choices. However, the three-digit number must satisfy both conditions for divisibility by 2 and 3. Let's handle each condition separately and then combine them appropriately.\n\nStarting with divisibility by 2: The last digit (units place) must be even. From our allowed digits (5,6,7,8,9), the even ones are 6 and 8. So, for the units digit, there are 2 choices: 6 or 8.\n\nNow, for divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits must be a multiple of 3. So, if I denote the three-digit number as ABC (where A is hundreds, B is tens, C is units), then A + B + C must be divisible by 3. We already know C can be 6 or 8, so we need to consider the possible combinations of A and B such that when we add them to C, the total is a multiple of 3.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\n1. Hundreds digit (A): 5 choices (5,6,7,8,9)\n2. Tens digit (B): 5 choices (5,6,7,8,9)\n3. Units digit (C): 2 choices (6,8)\n\nTotal numbers without considering divisibility by 6: 5 * 5 * 2 = 50.\n\nBut we need only those that are divisible by 6. So, we need to find the subset of these 50 numbers where A + B + C is divisible by 3. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nSince the sum A + B + C must be divisible by 3, and C is either 6 or 8, let's analyze each case separately.\n\nCase 1: C = 6\nThen, the sum A + B + 6 must be divisible by 3. Which is equivalent to A + B \u2261 0 mod 3 (since 6 \u2261 0 mod 3). Therefore, A + B must be \u2261 0 mod 3.\n\nCase 2: C = 8\nSimilarly, sum A + B + 8 must be divisible by 3. Since 8 \u2261 2 mod 3, this means A + B \u2261 1 mod 3.\n\nTherefore, depending on whether C is 6 or 8, we have different congruency requirements for A + B. Let me handle each case.\n\nFirst, let's compute the number of possible (A, B) pairs where A + B \u2261 0 mod 3 (when C=6) and A + B \u2261 1 mod 3 (when C=8). Then, for each case, multiply the number of valid (A,B) pairs by the number of C's (2 for each case). But wait, in reality, for each C, the number of (A,B) pairs is fixed as per their sum's congruence.\n\nSo total numbers would be (number of (A,B) pairs with A + B \u2261 0 mod 3 when C=6) * 1 (since C=6, there's 1 choice for C) + (number of (A,B) pairs with A + B \u2261 1 mod 3 when C=8) * 1. Then, the total numbers would be sum of these.\n\nBut let me verify:\n\nSince for each C (6 or 8), there is a condition on A + B. So total numbers would be:\n\nFor C=6: (Number of (A,B) pairs where A+B \u2261 0 mod 3) * 1\n\nFor C=8: (Number of (A,B) pairs where A+B \u2261 1 mod 3) * 1\n\nSo total numbers = N1 + N2 where N1 is the count for C=6 and N2 for C=", 0.38999998569488525], ["35", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

So, we need to find the greatest four-digit integer m such that both m and its reverse are divisible by 45, and m is itself divisible by 7. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's recall that a number divisible by 45 must be divisible by both 9 and 5. Because 45 is 9 multiplied by 5, and since 9 and 5 are co-prime, the number has to satisfy both conditions. So, both m and its reverse must end with a 0 or 5 (because they need to be divisible by 5), and the sum of their digits must be a multiple of 9 (for divisibility by 9).\n\nAlso, m has to be divisible by 7. Since we're looking for the greatest possible value of m, we should check numbers starting from 9999 downwards until we find one that meets all these criteria.\n\nLet me structure this:\n\n1. **Divisibility by 5**: The last digit of m (and the first digit of the reversed number) must be 0 or 5. Therefore, m must end with 0 or 5, and its reverse must start with 0 or 5. But since m is a four-digit number, it can't start with 0. Similarly, the reverse of m, which would be the original last digit at the front, must also be a four-digit number, so the reverse can't start with 0. Therefore, both m and its reverse must end with 0 or 5. Wait, let's clarify:\n\n   - Let the original number m be represented as ABCD (four digits), so A \u2260 0. The reversed number is DCBA.\n\n   - For both numbers to be divisible by 5:\n\n     - For m: last digit D must be 0 or 5.\n\n     - For the reversed number: first digit A must be 0 or 5. But since A is a digit in a four-digit number, it can't be 0. Therefore, A must be 5.\n\n     Therefore, m must start with 5, and end with 0 or 5.\n\n   So, m is a four-digit number starting with 5, ending with 0 or 5.\n\n   Let's note that down:\n\n   - m is 5BCC0 or 5BC5 (if D is 0 or 5). Wait, more precisely, m is 5B C D, where B, C, D are digits. But for the reversed number DCBA to be divisible by 5 as well, the last digit A has to be 0 or 5. But since m is 5B C D, the reverse is D C B 5. Wait, no:\n\nWait, let's write m as ABCD. Then reversed is DCBA. For DCBA to be divisible by 5, its last digit must be 0 or 5. Therefore, A (the first digit of m) must be 0 or 5. But A can't be 0 because m is a four-digit number. Therefore, A must be 5. Therefore, the first digit of m is 5, and the last digit of the reversed number DCBA is A, which must be 0 or 5. But since A is 5, then the reversed number DCBA ends with 5, hence it is divisible by 5. Therefore, m must end with 5 (not 0) because the reversed number has to start with 5 (from above). Wait, let's check:\n\nWait, m is ABCD. So reversed is DCBA.\n\nFor DCBA to be divisible by 5, its last digit is A, so A must be 0 or 5. Since A is the first digit of a four-digit number, A can't be 0. Therefore, A must be 5. Therefore, m starts with 5. Then, since the reversed number DCBA must end with A = 5, so DCBA ends with 5. Therefore, D (the last digit of m) must be 5. Therefore, m must be a four-digit number starting with 5 and ending with 5. So, m is 5XX5, where X represents digits. Therefore, m is divisible by 5, which satisfies the divisibility by 5. So, the last digit is 5.\n\nTherefore, m is of the form 5XYZ5, where X, Y, Z are digits from 0 to 9. Wait, but wait. Let me confirm:\n\nNo, m is a four-digit number. So, ABCD where A=5, D=5. Then reversed is DCBA, which is 5BA C D.

So, we need to find a four-digit integer m such that both m and its reverse are divisible by 45. Additionally, m has to be divisible by 7. Our goal is to find the greatest possible value of m. Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, let's recall that a number divisible by 45 must be divisible by both 9 and 5. Because 45 is 9 times 5, and since 9 and 5 are coprime, the number has to be divisible by both. So, for a number to be divisible by 45, it needs to satisfy two conditions: divisibility by 5 and divisibility by 9.\n\nDivisibility by 5 is straightforward: the last digit of the number has to be either 0 or 5. Since m is a four-digit number, the last digit (the units place) can't be 0 because otherwise, reversing it would make the first digit of the reversed number 0, which isn't allowed (since it's a four-digit number). Therefore, the last digit of m must be 5. That simplifies things a bit because the reversed number, let's call it n, will have its first digit as the original last digit, which is 5. So n starts with 5, making it a four-digit number starting with 5. But wait, let's verify this logic. \n\nIf m is divisible by 5, then its last digit is 0 or 5. But if the last digit of m is 0, reversing it would give a number ending with 0, but the first digit would be 0, which isn't possible. Therefore, m must end with 5, and reversing it would start with 5, which is okay. So, both m and n (the reversed number) start and end with 5. Wait, but n would be the reversed number, so if m is abcd (a four-digit number), then n is dcba, which must start with d, which is the original last digit of m. Since m ends with 5, n starts with 5. So n is a four-digit number starting with 5. Similarly, m must end with 5.\n\nSo, both m and n (reversed m) are divisible by 45. Therefore, both m and n must be divisible by 9 and 5. Since m ends with 5, it's already divisible by 5, so we just need to check divisibility by 9. Similarly, n starts with 5, which is okay for divisibility by 5, so we need n to be divisible by 9 as well.\n\nBut m must be divisible by 9. Divisibility by 9 means the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 9. Similarly, n, which is the reverse of m, must also have its digits summing to a multiple of 9. So, the sum of the digits of m must equal the sum of the digits of n, and both must be divisible by 9. But since n is the reverse of m, the sum of the digits remains the same. Therefore, the sum of the digits of m must be a multiple of 9.\n\nAlso, m is divisible by 7. So, putting all this together: we need a four-digit number m starting and ending with 5 (since reversed number starts with 5 and ends with 5), with the sum of its digits divisible by 9, and m must be divisible by 7. And we need the largest such m.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. m is a four-digit number: 1000 \u2264 m \u2264 9999\n2. m ends with 5: m \u2261 5 mod 10\n3. m is divisible by 7: m \u2261 0 mod 7\n4. The sum of the digits of m is divisible by 9\n5. The reversed number n = reverse(m) is also divisible by 45, which as we said, since n starts with 5, it's already divisible by 5, and its digits sum to the same sum as m, so it's divisible by 9.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the largest four-digit number ending with 5, divisible by 7, and with digit sum divisible by 9.\n\nLet me verify this logic again. If m is divisible by 45, it must end with 5 and have a digit sum divisible by 9. Since reversing m gives n, which must start with 5 (same as m's last digit), n is a four-digit number starting with 5, and since n is also divisible by 45, it must end with 5 and have a digit sum divisible by 9.

The problem says:\n\nA four-digit integer \\( m \\) and the four-digit integer obtained by reversing the order of the digits of \\( m \\) are both divisible by 45. If \\( m \\) is divisible by 7, what is the greatest possible value of \\( m \\)?\n\nFirst, let me break down what I know. A number divisible by 45 must be divisible by both 9 and 5. So, both \\( m \\) and its reverse are divisible by 45, which means each must be divisible by 9 and 5. Let me recall the divisibility rules for 9 and 5.\n\nDivisibility by 5 means the last digit has to be either 0 or 5. Divisibility by 9 means the sum of the digits must be a multiple of 9.\n\nGiven that \\( m \\) is a four-digit number, its reverse will also be a four-digit number. So, the last digit of \\( m \\) becomes the first digit of its reverse. Similarly, the first digit of \\( m \\) becomes the last digit of its reverse.\n\nSince both the original number and its reverse are divisible by 5, their last digits (which are the first digits of each other) must be 0 or 5. Let me note that:\n\nLet \\( m = \\overline{abcd} \\), where \\( a, b, c, d \\) are digits, and \\( a \\neq 0 \\) because it's a four-digit number. Then the reverse of \\( m \\), which is \\( \\overline{dcba} \\), must also end with a 0 or 5. Therefore, \\( a \\) must be 0 or 5. But \\( a \\) can't be 0 because it's the first digit of a four-digit number. So, \\( a = 5 \\). Similarly, the reverse of \\( m \\) ends with \\( a \\), which is 5, so the reverse number ends with 5, which satisfies the divisibility by 5. Therefore, \\( a = 5 \\).\n\nSo, \\( m \\) starts with 5. Now, let's write down \\( m = 5bcd \\). Then, the reverse is \\( 5cd5 \\). Wait, no. Wait, hold on. Wait, the original number is \\( 5bcd \\), so the reverse would be \\( dcb5 \\). Wait, but in the problem statement, the reverse is a four-digit integer. So, if \\( m \\) ends with 0, then reversing it would start with 0, which isn't allowed. Therefore, it must end with 5. Therefore, the last digit of \\( m \\) is 5, so the first digit of the reverse is 5. So, \\( m = 5bcd \\), and reverse is \\( 5cd5 \\). Wait, but that can't be. Wait, no. Wait, the original number is four digits. If \\( m = 5bcd \\), then when reversed, it's \\( d cb5 \\). But \\( m \\) is divisible by 5, so \\( d \\) must be 0 or 5. But the reverse starts with \\( d \\), so \\( d \\) must be 5, otherwise, the reverse would start with 0, making it a three-digit number, which is not allowed. Therefore, \\( d = 5 \\). Therefore, both \\( m \\) and its reverse end with 5. So, \\( m \\) is 5bcd and its reverse is 5cb5. Therefore, \\( m \\) must end with 5, and its reverse starts with 5. Therefore, both numbers are four-digit numbers divisible by 5.\n\nTherefore, the first digit of \\( m \\) is 5, and the last digit is 5. So, \\( m = 5bc5 \\), and the reverse is 5cb5. So, both numbers are 5bc5 and 5cb5. Therefore, the reverse of 5bc5 is 5cb5.\n\nSo, that simplifies the structure. Now, both numbers are divisible by 9 as well. Therefore, the sum of the digits of both numbers must be a multiple of 9.\n\nLet me check that. For \\( m = 5bc5 \\), the sum is \\( 5 + b + c + 5 = 10 + b + c \\). For the reverse, \\( 5cb5 \\), the sum is \\( 5 + c + b + 5 = 10 + b + c \\). So, both have the same digit sum, which is \\( 10 + b + c \\).

If $m$ is divisible by 7, what is the greatest possible value of $m$?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the problem is: A four-digit integer m and its reverse are both divisible by 45. Also, m is divisible by 7. We need to find the greatest possible value of m.\n\nFirst, let me recall that a number divisible by 45 must be divisible by both 9 and 5 because 45 is 9 multiplied by 5, and 9 and 5 are co-prime. So, both m and its reverse must be divisible by 9 and 5. That's a key point. Let me jot that down.\n\nDivisibility by 5: A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is either 0 or 5. Similarly, reversing the digits of m would make the original last digit become the first digit of the reversed number, which is in the thousands place. So, the reversed number's last digit is the original number's first digit. Therefore, the reversed number will be divisible by 5 if and only if the original number's first digit is 0 or 5. But since m is a four-digit number, its first digit can't be 0. So, the original number's first digit must be 5. Therefore, m must start with 5. So, m is of the form 5abc, where a, b, c are digits. Then, when reversed, it becomes cba5, which must also be divisible by 5. But since cba5 ends with 5, it's automatically divisible by 5. So, that's satisfied. Therefore, the first digit of m is 5. Got that.\n\nNow, the original number m (5abc) and its reverse (cba5) must both be divisible by 9. Divisibility by 9 requires that the sum of the digits is a multiple of 9. So, for m, the sum is 5 + a + b + c, and for the reverse, the sum is c + b + a + 5. So, both sums are 5 + a + b + c, because addition is commutative. Therefore, both m and its reverse have the same digit sum. So, we need 5 + a + b + c to be a multiple of 9. Therefore, the sum of the digits a + b + c must be congruent to 4 mod 9, since 5 + (a + b + c) \u2261 0 mod 9 \u21d2 a + b + c \u2261 4 mod 9. So, the sum of the middle three digits a, b, c must end up being 4, 13, 22, etc. But since a, b, c are digits (each from 0 to 9), their sum can be at most 9 + 9 + 9 = 27. So possible sums are 4, 13, 22. But 22 would require a + b + c = 22, but since each digit is at most 9, the maximum sum for three digits is 27. 22 is possible (for example, 9 + 9 + 4, etc.), but let's check if that's feasible. Let's see:\n\nIf a + b + c = 22, then the sum of the digits is 5 + 22 = 27, which is divisible by 9 (since 27 \u00f7 9 = 3). So, 27 is a possible sum. Similarly, if a + b + c = 13, sum is 18, which is also divisible by 9. Similarly, sum 4: 5 + 4 = 9, which is divisible by 9. So, possible sums: 4, 13, 22.\n\nBut we want the largest possible m, so we need the largest possible four-digit number starting with 5, so ideally the thousands digit 5, then hundreds digit as high as possible. So, m is 5abc. To maximize m, we need to maximize the hundreds digit (a), then the tens digit (b), then the units digit (c). So, let's start by maximizing a. a is the hundreds digit. So, a can be from 0 to 9. Let's check possible values.\n\nBut first, let's recall that m must be divisible by 7. So, after considering divisibility by 45, we need to further check divisibility by 7. So, steps are:\n\n1. m is divisible by 5 (first digit is 5).\n\n2. m is divisible by 9 (sum of digits is multiple of 9).\n\n3.

So, we need to find a four-digit number m that's divisible by 45, its reverse is also divisible by 45, and m is divisible by 7. Also, we need the greatest possible m. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, knowing that a number is divisible by 45 means it must be divisible by both 9 and 5, right? Since 45 is 9 times 5, and 9 and 5 are coprime. So, for a number to be divisible by 45, it needs to satisfy the divisibility rules for both 9 and 5.\n\nStarting with the divisibility by 5: a number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is either 0 or 5. That means m ends with 0 or 5, and when we reverse it, the first digit (since the original number's fourth digit becomes the first digit of the reversed one) must also be 0 or 5. But since m is a four-digit number, the first digit can't be 0. So, the last digit of m must be 0 or 5, and the first digit of the reversed number (which is the last digit of m) must also be 0 or 5. But since m is a four-digit number, the first digit can't be 0. Therefore, the last digit of m must be 0 or 5, and the first digit of m must also be 0 or 5. Wait, no. Let's clarify:\n\nOriginal number m: digits are D1 D2 D3 D4. reversed number is D4 D3 D2 D1.\n\nFor divisibility by 5: D4 and D1 must be 0 or 5.\n\nBut since m is a four-digit number, D1 can't be 0. So D1 must be 5. Therefore, D4 (from original number m) must be 5. So both D1=5 and D4=5. So m is a number like 5 D2 D3 5.\n\nSo m is a four-digit number starting and ending with 5. Therefore, the number looks like 5xy5, where x and y are digits from 0 to 9.\n\nSo possible numbers are from 5005 up to 5995. Now, these numbers must also be divisible by 9. Divisibility by 9 requires that the sum of the digits is a multiple of 9. So, the sum D1 + D2 + D3 + D4 must be divisible by 9. Since D1 and D4 are both 5, the sum is 5 + D2 + D3 + 5 = 10 + D2 + D3. So, 10 + D2 + D3 must be divisible by 9. Therefore, D2 + D3 + 10 \u2261 0 mod 9 \u21d2 D2 + D3 \u2261 -10 \u2261 8 mod 9. So D2 + D3 must be congruent to 8 modulo 9. Since D2 and D3 are digits (0-9), their sum can range from 0+0=0 to 9+9=18. Therefore, possible sums for D2 + D3 are 8 or 17 (since 8 and 17 are the numbers between 0 and 18 congruent to 8 mod 9). Wait, 8 mod 9 is 8, and 17 mod 9 is 8 (since 17 - 9 = 8). So D2 + D3 =8 or 17.\n\nTherefore, possible values for D2 and D3 are pairs where their sum is 8 or 17. Let's note that.\n\nSo now, m is 5xy5, where x + y =8 or 17. So, next step is to check for numbers where m is divisible by 7. So, the number 5xy5 must be divisible by 7. So, our goal is to find the largest such number, so we need to check from the largest possible numbers downwards (i.e., from 5995 down to 5005) and check if they satisfy all the conditions: divisible by 5, sum of digits divisible by 9, and divisible by 7.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to approach this step by step. Let's see:\n\nPossible numbers are 5xy5 where x + y =8 or 17. So, let's generate all possible numbers with x + y =8 or 17.\n\nFirst, let's list numbers where x + y =8:\n\nPossible pairs (x,y):\n\nIf x=0, y=8\n\nx=1", 0.5400000214576721], ["35", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

So, we have a four-digit integer m, and its reverse is also divisible by 45. Additionally, m must be divisible by 7. We need to find the greatest possible value of m. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, let's recall that a number divisible by 45 must be divisible by both 9 and 5. That's because 45 is 9 multiplied by 5. So, for m and its reverse to be divisible by 45, they each need to satisfy the divisibility rules for 9 and 5.\n\nStarting with divisibility by 5: a number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is either 0 or 5. Since m is a four-digit number, its first digit can't be 0. So, the reverse of m will have its last digit as the first digit of m. Therefore, the first digit of m must be either 0 or 5. But since m is a four-digit number, the first digit can't be 0. Hence, the first digit must be 5. That means m is 5... something, and when reversed, it becomes ...55. Wait, let me check that again.\n\nIf m is a four-digit number, let's denote it as ABCD, where A, B, C, D are digits, and A is not 0. The reverse of m would be DCBA. For m to be divisible by 5, D must be 0 or 5. Similarly, for DCBA to be divisible by 5, A must be 0 or 5. But since A can't be 0, A must be 5. Therefore, both m and its reverse must start and end with 5. So, m is 5BCD and its reverse is DCB5. Therefore, D must be 5 because the reverse must start with D which is equal to A (5). Therefore, m is 5BC5, and its reverse is 5CB5.\n\nWait, but m is 5BCD, so D is the last digit. The reverse is DCBA, so the first digit of the reverse is D, which must also be 5. Therefore, D=5. So, m is 5BC5, and its reverse is 5CB5. Therefore, m is a four-digit number starting and ending with 5. So m is of the form 5BC5.\n\nTherefore, m is 5BC5, and its reverse is also 5CB5. Since m must be divisible by 9 and 5, and its reverse must also be divisible by 9 and 5. But we already handled the divisibility by 5. So, now we need to ensure that both m and its reverse are divisible by 9. For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 9.\n\nSo, for m = 5BC5, the sum of the digits is 5 + B + C + 5 = 10 + B + C. This sum must be a multiple of 9. Similarly, for the reverse number 5CB5, the sum of the digits is 5 + C + B + 5 = 10 + C + B. Which is the same as m. So, the sum is the same for both numbers. Therefore, if m is divisible by 9, then its reverse is automatically divisible by 9. So, the key is just ensuring that 10 + B + C is divisible by 9. Therefore, B + C must equal 9 - 10 mod 9? Wait, let's see.\n\nSo, 10 + B + C \u2261 0 mod 9. Therefore, B + C \u2261 -10 mod 9. Which is equivalent to B + C \u2261 -1 mod 9 (since -10 mod 9 is -1). But -1 mod 9 is 8. So, B + C \u2261 8 mod 9. Therefore, B + C = 8 or 17. Because B and C are digits between 0 and 9, so their sum can be at most 18. So possible sums are 8 or 17.\n\nSo, B + C is either 8 or 17. Therefore, possible values for B and C. Our next step is to find the maximum possible m, which is 5BC5. Since m is 5 followed by B, C, 5, to make m as large as possible, we need B to be as large as possible, then C. So, first maximize B, then maximize C.\n\nSo, let's consider B first.

The problem says that we have a four-digit integer m, and when you reverse its digits, you get another four-digit integer that's also divisible by 45. Additionally, m itself is divisible by 7. We need to find the greatest possible value of m.\n\nFirst, let's recall that a number divisible by 45 must be divisible by both 9 and 5. So, the four-digit number m must satisfy both those divisibility rules, and the reversed number must also satisfy them as well.\n\nStarting with m being divisible by 5: that means its last digit must be either 0 or 5. Similarly, the reversed number, which is a four-digit number, must also be divisible by 5. The reversed number's last digit would then be the original number's first digit. Therefore, the reversed number's last digit is m's first digit. For the reversed number to be divisible by 5, that first digit must also be 0 or 5. However, the original number m is a four-digit number, so its first digit can't be 0. Similarly, the reversed number is a four-digit number, so its first digit (which is m's last digit) also can't be 0. Therefore, both m's last digit and its first digit must be 5. So, m is of the form 5ABC, and upon reversing, it becomes CBA5, which must also be a four-digit number, so C can't be 0 either. Therefore, m must start and end with 5.\n\nSo, m is a four-digit number starting and ending with 5. Therefore, m is between 5000 and 5995. But since m is a four-digit number, the maximum possible value of m is 5999, but since it must end with 5, the maximum m is 5995. But we need to check if this number meets the other conditions.\n\nNext, both m and its reverse must be divisible by 9. A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9. Let's confirm that for both m and its reverse.\n\nFirst, for m = 5ABC5, the sum of its digits is 5 + A + B + C + 5 = 10 + A + B + C. For this to be divisible by 9, 10 + A + B + C \u2261 0 mod 9, so A + B + C \u2261 -10 \u2261 -1 \u2261 8 mod 9. Therefore, A + B + C \u2261 8 mod 9. Similarly, for the reversed number, which is CBA5, the sum of its digits is C + B + A + 5. The same sum applies, so the same condition applies: C + B + A \u2261 8 mod 9. So both numbers satisfy the same digit sum condition. Therefore, if m's digits A, B, C satisfy A + B + C \u2261 8 mod 9, both numbers will be divisible by 9 and 5, hence by 45.\n\nSo our next step is to find the largest possible m (i.e., the largest four-digit number starting and ending with 5) such that m is divisible by 7, and the sum A + B + C \u2261 8 mod 9.\n\nSo let's rephrase m as a four-digit number: m = 5000 + 100A + 10B + C, where A, B, C are digits from 0 to 9, with the constraint that A + B + C \u2261 8 mod 9.\n\nOur goal is to maximize m, which is equivalent to maximizing 5000 + 100A + 10B + C. To do this, we should try to maximize A, then B, then C.\n\nStarting with the largest possible m, which is 5995. Let's check if 5995 meets the conditions.\n\nFirst, check divisibility by 5: yes, ends with 5. Reverse is 5995 reversed is 5995, which is the same, so it's divisible by 5. Now check divisibility by 9: sum of digits 5 + 9 + 9 + 5 = 28. 28 mod 9 is 1, which is not 0. So 28 is not divisible by 9, so 5995 is not divisible by 45. Therefore, 5995 is out.\n\nNext, try the next possible number: 5985. Reverse is 5895.

Wait, actually, since the quadratic is \\( b^2 -7b +10 \\), the factors would be \\( (b - \\alpha)(b - \\beta) \\), where \\( \\alpha \\times \\beta = 10 \\) and \\( \\alpha + \\beta = 7 \\). Let's see, 2 and 5 multiply to 10 and add up to 7. So, the factors would be \\( (b - 2)(b - 5) \\). Let me check: \\( (b - 2)(b - 5) = b^2 -5b -2b +10 = b^2 -7b +10 \\). Yes, that's correct. So, the roots are \\( b = 2 \\) and \\( b = 5 \\).\n\nSo, the quadratic expression \\( b^2 -7b +10 \\) factors to \\( (b - 2)(b - 5) \\). Now, since the coefficient of \\( b^2 \\) is positive (1), the parabola opens upwards. That means the expression is below or equal to zero between the roots, right? Because the parabola is opening upwards, the area under the x-axis is between the roots. Therefore, \\( (b - 2)(b - 5) \\le 0 \\) when \\( b \\) is between 2 and 5, inclusive. So, the solution set for the inequality \\( b^2 -7b +10 \\le 0 \\) is \\( [2, 5] \\).\n\nBut wait, the original inequality was \\( -b^2 +7b -10 \\ge 0 \\), which we converted to \\( b^2 -7b +10 \\le 0 \\). Therefore, the solution is \\( b \\) in [2, 5]. So, the greatest value of \\( b \\) that satisfies the inequality is 5. Therefore, the answer should be 5. Let me double-check this to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me substitute \\( b = 5 \\) into the original inequality: \\( -5^2 + 7*5 -10 = -25 + 35 -10 = 0 \\). So, that's equal to 0, which satisfies the inequality \\( \\ge 0 \\). If I take a value greater than 5, say \\( b = 6 \\), then \\( -6^2 +7*6 -10 = -36 +42 -10 = -4 \\), which is less than 0. Similarly, if I take a value less than 2, say \\( b = 1 \\): \\( -1^2 +7*1 -10 = -1 +7 -10 = -4 \\), which is also less than 0. So, indeed, the inequality is only true between 2 and 5, inclusive. Hence, the greatest value is 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe greatest value of \\( b \\) is \\boxed{5}.\n</", 1.5], ["35", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Hmm, let's see. Alright, first step, maybe I should rewrite the inequality to make it a bit easier to handle. Since the coefficient of b\u00b2 is negative (-1), this quadratic opens downward, which means it has a maximum point. Since the problem is asking for the greatest value of b where the expression is non-negative, that probably relates to the larger root of the equation where the expression equals zero. Let me confirm that.\n\nSo, the standard quadratic equation is ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0. In this case, the given inequality is -b\u00b2 + 7b -10 \u2265 0. Let me rearrange that to standard form. If I multiply both sides by -1 (remembering to reverse the inequality), it becomes b\u00b2 -7b +10 \u2264 0. Now, this is a quadratic that opens upwards (since the coefficient of b\u00b2 is positive). The roots of this equation will help me determine where the expression is less than or equal to zero, which should be between the two roots because it opens upwards. Therefore, the original inequality -b\u00b2 +7b -10 \u22650 is satisfied between the two roots of the equation b\u00b2 -7b +10 =0. So, solving that equation first will help me find the interval where the original inequality holds true.\n\nAlright, let's solve b\u00b2 -7b +10 =0. To factor this, I need two numbers that multiply to 10 and add up to -7. Let's see, factors of 10 are 1 and 10, 2 and 5. Since the middle term is -7b, and the constant term is +10, both numbers should be negative. So, -2 and -5 multiply to 10 and add up to -7. Therefore, the equation factors to (b - 2)(b -5)=0. Wait, but if we factor with negatives, it's (b - 2)(b -5)=0. So the roots are b=2 and b=5. Therefore, the quadratic b\u00b2 -7b +10 factors as (b -2)(b -5). Therefore, the original inequality -b\u00b2 +7b -10 \u22650 is equivalent to (b -2)(b -5) \u22640.\n\nNow, the product of (b -2) and (b -5) is less than or equal to zero. To find where this product is \u22640, we can test intervals. The critical points are at b=2 and b=5. So, the intervals to test are:\n\n1. b <2: Let's pick b=0. Then (0 -2)(0 -5)= (-2)(-5)=10 which is positive. So the inequality is not satisfied here.\n\n2. Between 2 and 5: Let's pick b=3. (3-2)(3-5)=(1)(-2)= -2 which is negative. So the inequality is satisfied here.\n\n3. b >5: Let's pick b=6. (6-2)(6-5)=(4)(1)=4 which is positive. So not satisfied here.\n\nTherefore, the solution set is [2,5]. So, the inequality -b\u00b2 +7b -10 \u22650 holds when b is between 2 and 5, inclusive. Therefore, the greatest value of b satisfying the inequality is 5. So, the answer is 5.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me substitute b=5 back into the original expression: -5\u00b2 +7*5 -10= -25 +35 -10= (-25 +35)=10, then 10 -10=0. So 0 is indeed equal to zero, which satisfies the inequality. Similarly, if I check b=2: -4 +14 -10=0. Also satisfies. So 5 is the upper bound, and 2 is the lower bound. Since the question asks for the greatest value of b, the answer is 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe greatest value of \\( b \\) is \\boxed{5}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the greatest value of \\( b \\) such that \\( -b^2 + 7b - 10 \\ge 0 \\), we start by rewriting the inequality in a more manageable form. Multiplying both sides by -1 (and reversing the inequality sign) gives:\n\n\\[\nb^2 - 7b + 10 \\le 0\n\\]\n\nNext, we solve the quadratic equation \\( b^2 - 7b + 10 = ", 1.5], ["35", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Hmm, let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that quadratic inequalities like this one can be solved by finding the roots of the corresponding equation and then testing intervals between the roots to see where the inequality holds. Let me confirm that approach. The quadratic equation is -b\u00b2 +7b -10 = 0. Let me rearrange it to make it easier to work with. Multiplying both sides by -1 to make the coefficient of b\u00b2 positive would flip the inequality, but since we're looking for when the original expression is non-negative (\u22650), maybe I should proceed without flipping the inequality first. Wait, actually, if I multiply both sides by -1, the inequality direction would change, so I need to be careful with that step. Let me check.\n\nThe original inequality is -b\u00b2 +7b -10 \u2265 0. If I multiply both sides by -1, it becomes b\u00b2 -7b +10 \u2264 0. That's easier to work with because the coefficient of b\u00b2 is positive. So perhaps I can solve b\u00b2 -7b +10 \u2264 0 first and then relate it back to the original inequality. Let me verify if this is a valid approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can factor the original quadratic. Let me check if -b\u00b2 +7b -10 can be factored. Let's see:\n\nFirst, factor out a negative sign: - (b\u00b2 -7b +10). Now factor the quadratic inside the parentheses. Let's look for two numbers that multiply to +10 and add up to -7. Because the middle term is -7b, the factors should be both negative. Indeed, -2 and -5 multiply to +10 and add up to -7. So, b\u00b2 -7b +10 factors into (b - 2)(b - 5). Therefore, the original expression can be written as - (b - 2)(b - 5). So the inequality becomes - (b - 2)(b - 5) \u2265 0. Which is equivalent to (b - 2)(b - 5) \u2264 0.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So if I have - (b - 2)(b - 5) \u2265 0, that is the same as (b - 2)(b - 5) \u2264 0. So now I can solve (b - 2)(b - 5) \u2264 0. Let me sketch the number line and find the critical points at b = 2 and b = 5. I need to test the intervals between these points and also check the sign around the critical points.\n\nThe critical points divide the real number line into three intervals:\n\n1. b < 2\n2. 2 < b < 5\n3. b > 5\n\nLet me pick test points in each interval.\n\n1. For b < 2, let's take b = 1. Plug into (b - 2)(b - 5): (1 - 2)(1 - 5) = (-1)(-4) = 4 > 0. So the product is positive here.\n\n2. For 2 < b < 5, let's take b = 3. Plug in: (3 - 2)(3 - 5) = (1)(-2) = -2 < 0. So the product is negative here.\n\n3. For b > 5, let's take b = 6. Plug in: (6 - 2)(6 - 5) = (4)(1) = 4 > 0. Product is positive here.\n\nSo the inequality (b - 2)(b - 5) \u2264 0 is satisfied in the interval [2, 5]. The endpoints are included because the original inequality is \u2265 0, so the endpoints where the expression equals zero are included. Therefore, the solution is 2 \u2264 b \u2264 5.\n\nTherefore, the greatest value of b is 5. Let me verify this.\n\nAt b = 5: -5\u00b2 +7*5 -10 = -25 +35 -10 = 0. Yes, which satisfies \u22650.\n\nAt b just less than 5, say 4.9: -4.9\u00b2 +7*4.9 -10. Let's compute that. 4.9\u00b2 is 24.01, 7*4.9 is 34.3. So -24.01 +34.3 -10 = 0.29, which is positive.

I need to find the greatest value of b such that the expression -b\u00b2 + 7b - 10 is greater than or equal to zero. Hmm, that's a quadratic inequality, right? So the first step is probably to solve the quadratic equation -b\u00b2 + 7b - 10 = 0 and then figure out the intervals where the quadratic is non-negative.\n\nQuadratic equations can be solved using the quadratic formula, which is x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)]/(2a). Wait, but here the variable is b, but the coefficients would be: in the standard quadratic form ax\u00b2 + bx + c, the coefficient of b\u00b2 is -1, then 7b, and the constant term is -10. Let me confirm that. So the equation is -b\u00b2 + 7b - 10 = 0. So a = -1, b = 7, c = -10 in the standard quadratic formula. Wait, hold on, I might have confused the coefficients. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the quadratic equation is -b\u00b2 + 7b - 10 = 0. So writing it in the standard form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, the coefficients are: a = -1, coefficient of b\u00b2 is -1; then the coefficient of b is 7; and the constant term c is -10. So yes, a = -1, b = 7, c = -10. So when I use the quadratic formula, it's going to be:\n\nb = [-7 \u00b1 \u221a(7\u00b2 - 4*(-1)*(-10))]/(2*(-1)).\n\nLet me compute the discriminant first: D = 7\u00b2 - 4*(-1)*(-10) = 49 - 40 = 9. So \u221aD = 3.\n\nSo the roots are [-7 \u00b1 3]/(-2). Let's compute both roots.\n\nFirst root: [-7 + 3]/(-2) = (-4)/(-2) = 2.\n\nSecond root: [-7 - 3]/(-2) = (-10)/(-2) = 5.\n\nSo the quadratic crosses the b-axis at b = 2 and b = 5. Now, since the coefficient of b\u00b2 is negative (a = -1), the parabola opens downward. That means the quadratic is positive between the roots and negative outside the interval [2, 5]. But the question is asking for where -b\u00b2 + 7b -10 \u2265 0, which corresponds to where the quadratic is non-negative. Since it opens downward, the quadratic is non-negative between the roots, so between b = 2 and b = 5 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the solution set is [2,5]. The greatest value of b in this interval is 5. So the answer should be 5.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Let me plug in b = 5 into the original expression: -5\u00b2 +7*5 -10 = -25 +35 -10 = 0. That works. What about b = 6: -6\u00b2 +7*6 -10 = -36 +42 -10 = -4, which is less than zero. So that's outside the interval. How about b = 1: -1 +7 -10 = -4, still negative.

I remember that quadratic inequalities can be solved by finding the roots of the quadratic equation, determining its direction (whether it opens upwards or downwards), and then figuring out the intervals where the inequality holds true. Since the coefficient of b\u00b2 is negative (-1), the parabola opens downward. That means the quadratic will be positive between its two roots. Therefore, the solution to the inequality will be the interval between the two roots where the parabola is above the x-axis.\n\nLet me confirm that. The general form of a quadratic is ax\u00b2 + bx + c. In this case, the coefficient a is -1. If a is positive, the parabola opens upwards, and the inequality would hold outside the roots. But since a is negative here, the parabola opens downwards, so the inequality -b\u00b2 +7b -10 \u2265 0 holds between the two roots. That makes sense. So I need to find the roots of the equation -b\u00b2 +7b -10 = 0, then check the interval between them.\n\nTo find the roots, I can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is (-B \u00b1 \u221a(B\u00b2 - 4AC)) / 2A, where A is the coefficient of b\u00b2, B is the coefficient of b, and C is the constant term. Let me plug in the values here. A = -1, B = 7, C = -10.\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, the standard quadratic equation is Ax\u00b2 + Bx + C = 0. In this case, the quadratic is -b\u00b2 +7b -10 = 0. So comparing, A is -1, B is 7, and C is -10. Let me make sure I don't mix up the signs. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo applying the quadratic formula:\n\nB = 7\n\nA = -1\n\nC = -10\n\nSo discriminant D = B\u00b2 - 4AC = (7)^2 - 4*(-1)*(-10) = 49 - 4*1*10 = 49 - 40 = 9.\n\nSo discriminant is 9, which is positive, so there are two real roots.\n\nCalculating the roots:\n\nRoots are [ -B \u00b1 \u221aD ] / (2A) = [ -7 \u00b1 \u221a9 ] / (2*(-1)) = [ -7 \u00b1 3 ] / (-2).\n\nLet me compute each root step by step.\n\nFirst root: [ -7 + 3 ] / (-2) = (-4)/(-2) = 2.\n\nSecond root: [ -7 - 3 ] / (-2) = (-10)/(-2) = 5.\n\nSo the roots are at b = 2 and b = 5.\n\nSince the parabola opens downward (coefficient of b\u00b2 is negative), the quadratic expression -b\u00b2 +7b -10 is greater than or equal to zero between the roots. That is, when b is between 2 and 5, inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the inequality is 2 \u2264 b \u2264 5. The greatest value of b in this interval is 5.\n\nWait, let me verify that. Let me test a value within the interval. Let's pick b = 4. Plug into the expression: -16 + 28 -10 = 2. Which is positive. So that's correct.\n\nWhat about a point outside the interval? Let's check b = 6: -36 + 42 -10 = -4, which is negative. Correct. What about b = 1? -1 +7 -10 = -4, also negative. So the inequality holds between 2 and 5. Therefore, the greatest value of b is 5.\n\nI don't see any mistakes here.

Let me think step by step about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that quadratic inequalities can be solved by finding the roots of the corresponding quadratic equation and then determining the intervals where the quadratic expression is non-negative or non-positive. Since the coefficient of b\u00b2 here is -1, which is negative, the parabola will open downward. That means the quadratic will be above the x-axis between its roots and negative outside of them. So, if I can find the roots of -b\u00b2 + 7b - 10 = 0, then the inequality -b\u00b2 + 7b - 10 \u2265 0 will hold between those roots. The greatest value of b in this interval would be the larger root. Let me check that.\n\nFirst step: let's find the roots of the equation -b\u00b2 + 7b - 10 = 0. Alternatively, I can multiply both sides by -1 to make it easier to handle. Multiplying by -1 reverses the inequality, so the inequality becomes b\u00b2 - 7b + 10 \u2264 0. Wait, but maybe it's better to just proceed step by step.\n\nStarting with the original inequality:\n\n-b\u00b2 + 7b - 10 \u2265 0\n\nLet me rearrange it to standard form by multiplying both sides by -1. However, multiplying an inequality by a negative number reverses the inequality sign. So:\n\nb\u00b2 - 7b + 10 \u2264 0\n\nAh, that might be simpler. So now the quadratic is positive (since the coefficient of b\u00b2 is positive) but we have it \u2264 0, which means between the roots the quadratic is below or equal to zero. Therefore, the original inequality -b\u00b2 + 7b -10 \u2265 0 will hold for values of b between the roots of the equation b\u00b2 -7b +10 =0.\n\nSo, let's solve the equation b\u00b2 -7b +10 =0.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nb = [7 \u00b1 \u221a(49 - 4*1*10)] / 2\n\nCalculating the discriminant:\n\nD = 49 - 40 = 9\n\nSo sqrt(D) = 3.\n\nThus, the roots are:\n\nb = [7 +3]/2 = 10/2 =5\n\nand\n\nb = [7 -3]/2 =4/2 =2\n\nTherefore, the roots are at b=2 and b=5. Since the quadratic b\u00b2 -7b +10 factors into (b -2)(b -5), and since the coefficient of b\u00b2 is positive, the parabola opens upwards, so it's below or equal to zero between the roots 2 and 5. Therefore, the inequality b\u00b2 -7b +10 \u2264 0 holds for b between 2 and 5 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, returning to the original inequality, since we multiplied by -1, reversing the inequality, the solution to the original inequality -b\u00b2 +7b -10 \u22650 is also b between 2 and 5 inclusive. Therefore, the greatest value of b for which the inequality holds is 5.\n\nWait, let me verify this to make sure. Let's check the endpoints and a point in between.\n\nFirst, check b=5:\n\nLeft-hand side: -5\u00b2 +7*5 -10 = -25 +35 -10 =0. So 0 \u22650 holds.\n\nb=2:\n\nLeft-hand side: -4 +14 -10 =0.

Hmm, let me think through this carefully.\n\nFirst, I remember that quadratic inequalities can be solved by finding the roots of the quadratic equation and then determining where the quadratic is non-negative or non-positive based on its leading coefficient. Since the coefficient of b\u00b2 is negative here (-1), the parabola will open downward. That means the quadratic will be positive between its two roots and negative outside of them. Therefore, to find where the expression is greater than or equal to zero, we need to find the interval between the two roots.\n\nLet me start by writing down the quadratic inequality:\n\n-b\u00b2 + 7b -10 \u2265 0\n\nHmm, usually when solving quadratic inequalities, it's easier if the coefficient of b\u00b2 is positive. Here, the coefficient is -1, so maybe I can multiply both sides by -1 to make it positive, but I have to remember that multiplying or dividing an inequality by a negative number reverses the inequality sign. Let me check that.\n\nMultiplying both sides by -1:\n\n-(-b\u00b2 + 7b -10) \u2264 -0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nb\u00b2 - 7b +10 \u2264 0\n\nWait, that's better because now the coefficient of b\u00b2 is positive. So, the inequality is now b\u00b2 -7b +10 \u2264 0. Now I need to find the roots of the quadratic equation b\u00b2 -7b +10 =0.\n\nLet me solve the equation b\u00b2 -7b +10 =0. Using the quadratic formula:\n\nb = [7 \u00b1 sqrt( (-7)\u00b2 -4*1*10 )]/(2*1)\n\nCalculating the discriminant:\n\nDiscriminant D = 49 -40 = 9\n\nSo sqrt(D)=3\n\nTherefore, the roots are:\n\nb = [7 \u00b13]/2\n\nCalculating the two roots:\n\nFirst root: (7 +3)/2 =10/2=5\n\nSecond root: (7 -3)/2 =4/2=2\n\nSo the quadratic equation factors as (b -2)(b -5) =0, which means the roots are at b=2 and b=5.\n\nNow, since the quadratic opens upwards (coefficient of b\u00b2 is positive), the expression b\u00b2 -7b +10 is less than or equal to zero between the roots. Wait, no. Wait, when the quadratic opens upwards, the parabola is upward, so it's below or equal to zero between its roots. Wait, actually, when you have a quadratic that opens upwards, the part of the parabola that's below the x-axis is between the roots, so the inequality b\u00b2 -7b +10 \u22640 is satisfied between the roots. Therefore, the solution to the inequality b\u00b2 -7b +10 \u22640 is 2 \u2264b \u22645.\n\nBut since we multiplied the original inequality by -1, we have to reverse the inequality sign. So the original inequality -b\u00b2 +7b -10 \u22650 is equivalent to b\u00b2 -7b +10 \u22640, which is true when 2 \u2264b \u22645. Therefore, the greatest value of b that satisfies the original inequality is 5.\n\nLet me verify this with a test value. Let's pick b=5. Plugging into the original inequality:\n\n-(5)^2 +7*5 -10 = -25 +35 -10 = (-25 -10) +35 = -35 +35=0. So 0 \u22650 is true.\n\nWhat about b=6? Let's check: -6\u00b2 +7*6 -10 = -36 +42 -10 = (-36 -10) +42 = -46 +42= -4. Which is less than 0, so the inequality doesn't hold. How about b=1? Plugging in: -1 +7 -10= -4. Also negative.\n\nWhat about b=3? -9 +21 -10=2. Which is positive. So between 2 and 5, the expression is positive, at 2 and 5 it's zero. So yes, the interval [2,5] is correct.\n\nTherefore, the greatest value of b is 5. So the answer should be 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe greatest value of \\( b \\) is \\boxed{5}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the greatest value of \\( b \\) such that \\( -b^2 + 7b - 10 \\ge 0 \\), we start by rewriting the inequality in a form that is easier", 1.4800000190734863], ["35", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that when two lines intersect, their point of intersection satisfies both equations at the same time. That means the x and y values at that point must make both equations true. So, maybe I can use the first equation to substitute y into the second equation. Let me try that.\n\nThe first equation is y = 4x - 19. So, if I plug that in for y in the second equation, which is 2x + y = 95, it should work out. Let me write that down:\n\n2x + y = 95\n\nBut since y is 4x - 19, substituting that in:\n\n2x + (4x - 19) = 95\n\nNow, let me simplify this step by step. Combine like terms. 2x and 4x add up to 6x:\n\n6x - 19 = 95\n\nWait, but there's a minus 19 here. So, I need to solve for x. Let me add 19 to both sides to isolate the term with x:\n\n6x - 19 + 19 = 95 + 19\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n6x = 114\n\nNow, divide both sides by 6 to solve for x:\n\nx = 114 / 6\n\nHmm, 114 divided by 6. Let me check that division. 6 * 19 is 114 because 6*10 is 60, 6*9 is 54, 60+54=114. So, x = 19.\n\nWait, let me verify my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with substitution:\n\nOriginal equations: y = 4x -19 and 2x + y =95. Substitute y from the first equation into the second:\n\n2x + (4x -19) = 95\n\nCombine the 2x and 4x: 6x -19 = 95\n\nAdding 19 to both sides: 6x = 114\n\nDivide by 6: x=19. That seems right. Let me check if x=19 also satisfies the first equation. \n\nIf x=19, then y=4*(19) -19. 4*19 is 76. 76 -19 is 57. So y=57.\n\nNow, plug x=19 and y=57 into the second equation: 2*(19) +57= 38 +57=95. Which matches. So both equations give that result. Therefore, x=19 is indeed the correct solution. \n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me check if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by solving for y in the second equation and substituting into the first? Let's see.\n\nSecond equation: 2x + y =95. Let's solve for y: y =95 -2x.\n\nNow, substitute this into the first equation: 4x -19 =95 -2x.\n\nThen, solve for x:\n\n4x +2x =95 +19\n\n6x=114\n\nx=19. Same result. So, x=19 is confirmed by both methods. \n\nTherefore, the value of x at the point of intersection is 19.

Let me think step by step. First, I remember that when two lines intersect, their x and y coordinates are the same at that point. That means I can find the x by solving the two equations simultaneously. Let me write down the equations again to make sure I have them right:\n\n1. y = 4x - 19\n2. 2x + y = 95\n\nHmm, since the first equation already gives y in terms of x, maybe I can substitute that into the second equation. Let me try that. If I replace y in the second equation with (4x - 19), then the equation becomes:\n\n2x + (4x - 19) = 95\n\nNow, let me simplify that. Combine like terms:\n\n2x + 4x = 6x, so it becomes:\n\n6x - 19 = 95\n\nThen, I can solve for x by adding 19 to both sides:\n\n6x = 95 + 19\n\nWait, 95 + 19 is... let me check that. 95 + 10 is 105, then +9 more would be 114. So:\n\n6x = 114\n\nThen, divide both sides by 6:\n\nx = 114 / 6\n\nHmm, 114 divided by 6. Let me compute that. 6 goes into 114 how many times? 6*19 is 114 because 6*20 is 120, which is 6 more, so subtract one. So x is 19. Wait, 6*19 is 114, yes. So x is 19. Let me verify that.\n\nIf x is 19, then from the first equation, y = 4*19 - 19. Let's calculate that: 4*19 is 76, minus 19 is 57. So y is 57.\n\nNow, let's check if these values satisfy the second equation. The second equation is 2x + y = 95. Plugging in x=19 and y=57:\n\n2*19 + 57 = 38 + 57 = 95. Yes, that's correct. So both equations are satisfied when x=19 and y=57. Therefore, the value of x at the point of intersection is 19. \n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake when simplifying.

So, we have two lines: y = 4x - 19 and 2x + y = 95. We need to find the x-value where they intersect. Hmm, okay, intersecting lines mean their point of intersection is a solution that satisfies both equations. So, basically, we need to find the values of x and y where both equations are true at the same time. Since one equation is already solved for y, maybe substitution would work best here. Let me recall how substitution works. If we have two equations, and one is solved for one variable, we can plug that expression into the other equation, replacing that variable with the expression. Let me verify that. \n\nFirst, let's take the first equation: y = 4x - 19. That's already solved for y, so if I substitute this y into the second equation, 2x + y = 95, then I can solve for x. Let me write that out step by step. \n\nStarting with the second equation: 2x + y = 95. Since we know y equals 4x - 19, we can substitute that into the equation. So replacing y with 4x - 19 gives us: \n\n2x + (4x - 19) = 95.\n\nNow, combine like terms. Let's compute 2x + 4x, which is 6x. Then we have -19 left. So the equation becomes:\n\n6x - 19 = 95.\n\nTo solve for x, first, let's get rid of the -19 by adding 19 to both sides of the equation. \n\n6x - 19 + 19 = 95 + 19  \nWhich simplifies to  \n6x = 114.\n\nNow, divide both sides by 6 to isolate x:\n\n6x / 6 = 114 / 6  \nSo x = 19.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's verify each step. \n\nStarting substitution: correct, we substituted y from the first equation into the second. Then expanded the equation: 2x + 4x -19 = 95, which is 6x -19 =95. Then adding 19 to both sides gives 6x=114, which divides to x=19. That seems right. Let me check by plugging x=19 back into both equations to see if they yield the same y. \n\nFirst equation: y =4x -19. If x=19, then y=4*19 -19=76-19=57. \n\nSecond equation: 2x + y =95. If x=19 and y=57, then 2*19 +57=38 +57=95, which is correct. So both equations check out. Therefore, the value of x at the intersection is indeed 19. \n\nI don't think I made any errors here.

Hmm, let me think step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that when two lines intersect, their point of intersection is where both equations are true. So, that means at the point of intersection, both the x and y values satisfy both equations. Therefore, if I can solve these two equations together, I should find the coordinates (x, y) where they meet.\n\nThe first equation is already solved for y: y = 4x - 19. That might make substitution easier. The second equation is 2x + y = 95. If I can plug the expression for y from the first equation into the second one, I can solve for x. Let me try that.\n\nSo, substituting y in the second equation with the expression from the first equation, I get:\n\n2x + (4x - 19) = 95\n\nWait, let me check that step again. If y is 4x - 19, then replacing y in the second equation gives 2x + (4x - 19) = 95. That looks right. Now I need to simplify this equation step by step.\n\nFirst, combine like terms on the left side. The 2x and 4x can be combined:\n\n2x + 4x = 6x, so the equation becomes:\n\n6x - 19 = 95\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. To isolate x, I should first get rid of the -19 by adding 19 to both sides of the equation. Let me do that:\n\n6x - 19 + 19 = 95 + 19\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n\n6x = 114\n\nNow, divide both sides by 6 to solve for x:\n\nx = 114 / 6\n\nLet me compute that. 114 divided by 6 is... 6 goes into 114 how many times? 6*10=60, subtract 60 from 114, you get 54. 6*9=54. So 10+9=19. So 114 divided by 6 is 19. Therefore, x = 19.\n\nWait, let me verify that. Let me check if when x is 19, both equations give the same y. Let's substitute x = 19 into the first equation: y = 4*19 - 19 = 76 - 19 = 57. So y = 57.\n\nNow check the second equation: 2x + y = 95. Plugging x = 19 and y = 57, we get 2*19 + 57 = 38 + 57 = 95. Yes, that adds up correctly. So (19, 57) is indeed the point of intersection. \n\nTherefore, the value of x at the point of intersection is 19.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( x \\) at the point of intersection is \\boxed{19}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\) at the point of intersection of the lines \\( y = 4x - 19 \\) and \\( 2x + y = 95 \\), we substitute the expression for \\( y \\) from the first equation into the second equation.\n\nStarting with the substitution:\n\\[\n2x + (4x - 19) = 95\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms on the left side:\n\\[\n6x - 19 = 95\n\\]\n\nAdd 19 to both sides to isolate the term with \\( x \\):\n\\[\n6x = 114\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 6 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{114}{6} = 19\n\\]\n\nTo verify, substitute \\( x = 19 \\) back into the first equation:\n\\[\ny = 4(19) - 19 = 76 - 19 = 57\n\\]\n\nCheck the second equation with \\( x = 19 \\) and \\( y = 57 \\):\n\\[\n2(19) + 57 = 38 + 57 = 95\n\\]\n\nBoth equations are satisfied, confirming the solution.\n\nThe value of \\( x \\) at the point of intersection is \\(\\boxed{19}\\).\nsystem\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\nuser\n", 0.5600000023841858], ["35", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

What is the value of $x$ at the point of intersection?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem step by step. So, we have two lines: the first one is given by the equation y = 4x - 19, and the second one is 2x + y = 95. The question is asking for the value of x at their point of intersection. Hmm, okay. Let me recall that when two lines intersect, their x and y coordinates at that point are the same for both equations. So, basically, I need to find the x-value where both equations are satisfied. \n\nFirst, maybe I should write down both equations again to make sure I have them right. The first line is straightforward: y equals 4x minus 19. The second line is 2x plus y equals 95. So, since we already have y expressed in terms of x from the first equation, maybe I can substitute that into the second equation. That way, I can solve for x directly. Let me check if that makes sense. \n\nLet's see, substitute y = 4x - 19 into the second equation. So replacing y in 2x + y = 95 would give 2x + (4x - 19) = 95. Let me simplify that. Combine like terms: 2x + 4x is 6x, so 6x - 19 = 95. Then, to solve for x, I can add 19 to both sides to get rid of the constant term. That would give 6x = 95 + 19. Let me compute 95 + 19. Hmm, 95 plus 10 is 105, and then plus 9 more is 114. So, 6x = 114. Then, divide both sides by 6 to get x = 114 / 6. Let me do that division. 6 goes into 114 how many times? Well, 6 times 10 is 60, 6 times 15 is 90, so 6 times 19 is 114. So x equals 19. \n\nWait, let me verify that. If x is 19, then plugging back into the first equation, y = 4*19 - 19. Let's calculate that. 4 times 19 is 76, minus 19 is 57. So y equals 57. Now, let's check if this point (19, 57) satisfies the second equation. The second equation is 2x + y = 95. Plugging in x=19 and y=57: 2*19 is 38, and 57 added to that gives 38 + 57 = 95. Yes, that checks out. So x=19 is the correct answer. \n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. Let me go through the steps again. \n\nStarting with substitution: \nGiven y = 4x - 19 and 2x + y = 95. \nSo substitute y into the second equation: 2x + (4x - 19) = 95. \nCombine terms: 2x + 4x is 6x, so 6x - 19 = 95. \nAdd 19 to both sides: 6x = 114. \nDivide by 6: x = 19. \nThat seems correct. Then verifying with both equations gives consistent results. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check using elimination method to see if I get the same x value. Let's try that as a cross-check. \n\nOriginal equations:\n1) y = 4x - 19\n2) 2x + y = 95\n\nExpress both equations in standard form. The first equation is y = 4x - 19. If I subtract 4x from both sides, I get -4x + y = -19. \n\nNow, the second equation is 2x + y = 95. So, we have:\nEquation 1: -4x + y = -19\nEquation 2: 2x + y = 95\n\nIf I subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate y. Let's try that. \n\nEquation 2 minus Equation 1: \n(2x + y) - (-4x + y) = 95 - (-19)\nSimplify left side: 2x + y + 4x - y = 6x\nRight side: 95 + 19 = 114\n\n", 0.5299999713897705], ["35", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Let me break this down step by step. First, let me recall what the function f(x) looks like.\n\nThe function f(x) is defined as:\n- \\( x^2 - 4 \\) when \\( x \\geq -4 \\)\n- \\( x + 3 \\) when \\( x < -4 \\)\n\nSo, it's a piecewise function with two different expressions depending on whether x is greater than or equal to -4 or less than that. Now, I need to find all x such that \\( f(f(x)) = 5 \\). That means applying f twice and getting 5. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out what values of x make f(x) result in a number that can then be plugged into f again to get 5. So, maybe I should first solve \\( f(y) = 5 \\), where y is equal to f(x). Then, solve for x in both cases where y could be either \\( y^2 - 4 \\) or \\( y + 3 \\). Hmm, that sounds like a plan.\n\nLet me write that down. To find \\( f(f(x)) = 5 \\), set \\( f(x) = z \\), so that \\( f(z) = 5 \\). Then, solve for z first, and then solve for x in each case.\n\nSo first, solve \\( f(z) = 5 \\). Let's do that.\n\nCase 1: If z \u2265 -4, then f(z) = z\u00b2 - 4. Set this equal to 5:\n\n\\( z\u00b2 - 4 = 5 \\)\n\\( z\u00b2 = 9 \\)\n\\( z = 3 \\) or \\( z = -3 \\)\n\nBut we need to check if these solutions satisfy z \u2265 -4. Both 3 and -3 are greater than -4, so they are valid here.\n\nCase 2: If z < -4, then f(z) = z + 3. Set this equal to 5:\n\n\\( z + 3 = 5 \\)\n\\( z = 2 \\)\n\nBut 2 is not less than -4, so this solution is invalid here.\n\nTherefore, the solutions for z are z = 3 and z = -3. So, f(z) = 5 occurs when z is 3 or -3. Therefore, now we need to find all x such that f(x) = 3 or f(x) = -3.\n\nSo now, let's solve f(x) = 3 and f(x) = -3 separately, and then count all the solutions.\n\nFirst, solve f(x) = 3:\n\nAgain, since f(x) is defined piecewise, we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: x \u2265 -4, so f(x) = x\u00b2 - 4. Set this equal to 3:\n\n\\( x\u00b2 - 4 = 3 \\)\n\\( x\u00b2 = 7 \\)\n\\( x = \\sqrt{7} \\) or \\( x = -\\sqrt{7} \\)\n\nNow, check if these x satisfy x \u2265 -4. Both \u221a7 \u2248 2.6458 and -\u221a7 \u2248 -2.6458 are greater than -4, so both are valid.\n\nCase 2: x < -4, so f(x) = x + 3. Set this equal to 3:\n\n\\( x + 3 = 3 \\)\n\\( x = 0 \\)\n\nBut 0 is not less than -4, so this solution is invalid here. Thus, only x = \u221a7 and x = -\u221a7 are valid for f(x) = 3.\n\nNext, solve f(x) = -3:\n\nAgain, split into cases:\n\nCase 1: x \u2265 -4, f(x) = x\u00b2 - 4. Set equal to -3:\n\n\\( x\u00b2 - 4 = -3 \\)\n\\( x\u00b2 = 1 \\)\n\\( x = 1 \\) or \\( x = -1 \\)\n\nCheck if these x satisfy x \u2265 -4. Both 1 and -1 are greater than -4, so both are valid.\n\nCase 2: x < -4, f(x) = x + 3. Set equal to -3:\n\n\\( x + 3 = -3 \\)\n\\( x = -6 \\)\n\nCheck if x = -6 is less than -4. Yes, -6 < -4, so this is valid.\n\nTherefore, the solutions for f(x) = -3 are x = 1, x = -1, and x = -6.\n\nSo, compiling all the solutions:\n\nFrom f(x) = 3", 0.47999998927116394], ["35", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step. First, let me make sure I understand the function f(x) correctly. The function has two cases: if x is greater than or equal to -4, then f(x) is x squared minus 4; otherwise, if x is less than -4, f(x) is just x plus 3. Alright, so the function changes its definition depending on whether x is in the domain where the piece is defined.\n\nThe problem is asking for the number of solutions to f(f(x)) = 5. So, I need to find all x such that when I apply f twice, the result is 5. That means first f(x) must be a value that, when input into f again, gives 5. So, let's denote y = f(x). Then, we have f(y) = 5. Therefore, I need to find all y such that f(y) = 5, and then for each such y, find all x such that f(x) = y. Then, count all possible x's.\n\nLet me structure this step by step:\n\n1. Find all y such that f(y) = 5.\n2. For each y found, find all x such that f(x) = y.\n3. Combine all x's found and count them.\n\nAlright, starting with step 1: Find y such that f(y) = 5.\n\nGiven the piecewise function f(y):\n\n- If y \u2265 -4, then f(y) = y\u00b2 - 4.\n- If y < -4, then f(y) = y + 3.\n\nSo, setting each case equal to 5:\n\nCase 1: y \u2265 -4. Then, y\u00b2 - 4 = 5. Solving this equation:\n\ny\u00b2 - 4 = 5  \ny\u00b2 = 5 + 4  \ny\u00b2 = 9  \ny = \u00b13\n\nBut remember, in this case, y has to be \u2265 -4. So both y = 3 and y = -3 are \u2265 -4. Therefore, both are valid solutions here. So from Case 1, we get y = 3 and y = -3.\n\nCase 2: y < -4. Then, f(y) = y + 3 = 5. Solving:\n\ny + 3 = 5  \ny = 5 - 3  \ny = 2\n\nBut wait, this is a problem. Because in Case 2, we supposed y < -4, but y = 2 here is not less than -4. Therefore, this solution is invalid for Case 2. Therefore, in Case 2, there are no solutions. So overall, the solutions to f(y) = 5 are y = 3 and y = -3.\n\nSo, step 1 gives us two possible y values: 3 and -3.\n\nNow moving to step 2: For each y found, find all x such that f(x) = y.\n\nFirst, handle y = 3:\n\nWe need f(x) = 3. Let's solve this equation. Again, use the piecewise definition of f(x).\n\nCase 1: x \u2265 -4. Then, f(x) = x\u00b2 - 4. Set equal to 3:\n\nx\u00b2 - 4 = 3  \nx\u00b2 = 3 + 4  \nx\u00b2 = 7  \nx = \u00b1\u221a7\n\nBoth \u221a7 and -\u221a7 are greater than or equal to -4, since \u221a7 \u2248 2.645 and -\u221a7 \u2248 -2.645. So both solutions are valid here.\n\nCase 2: x < -4. Then, f(x) = x + 3. Set equal to 3:\n\nx + 3 = 3  \nx = 0\n\nBut x = 0 is not less than -4.

The function f(x) is piecewise defined: for x greater than or equal to -4, it's x squared minus 4, and otherwise, it's x plus 3. We need to find how many values of x satisfy f(f(x)) = 5. Hmm, okay. This seems like a composite function problem, so maybe I should start by understanding what f(f(x)) means. That would mean applying f twice\u2014first to x, then to the result. Our goal is to find all x such that when you apply f to x, then apply f again to that result, you get 5.\n\nFirst, let me write down the function again to make sure I have it right:\n\nf(x) = {\nx\u00b2 - 4, if x \u2265 -4;\nx + 3, otherwise\n}\n\nSo, f is defined differently based on whether x is \u2265 -4 or not. The first step is probably to consider f(f(x)) = 5. To do this, I might need to consider different cases depending on the value of x. Maybe I should first find the possible values that make f(y) = 5, because f(f(x)) = 5 would require that f(y) = 5 where y is f(x). Then, solving for y first, then going back to solve for x. Let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, solve f(y) = 5. Since f depends on whether y is \u2265 -4 or not, I need to split this into two cases.\n\nCase 1: y \u2265 -4. Then f(y) = y\u00b2 - 4. Set this equal to 5:\n\ny\u00b2 - 4 = 5\ny\u00b2 = 9\ny = 3 or y = -3\n\nNow, we need to check if these y values satisfy the condition y \u2265 -4. Both 3 and -3 are greater than -4, so both are valid in this case.\n\nCase 2: y < -4. Then f(y) = y + 3. Set this equal to 5:\n\ny + 3 = 5\ny = 2\n\nBut wait, in this case, we assumed y < -4, but y = 2 is not less than -4. So this solution is invalid here. Therefore, only from Case 1 do we get valid solutions y = 3 and y = -3.\n\nTherefore, f(y) = 5 requires that y is either 3 or -3. So to find x such that f(f(x)) = 5, we need to find all x such that f(x) = 3 or f(x) = -3. So essentially, x must satisfy either f(x) = 3 or f(x) = -3. Let's tackle these two equations separately.\n\nFirst, solve f(x) = 3.\n\nAgain, split into two cases based on the definition of f(x):\n\nCase 1: x \u2265 -4. Then f(x) = x\u00b2 - 4. Set this equal to 3:\n\nx\u00b2 - 4 = 3\nx\u00b2 = 7\nx = \u221a7 or x = -\u221a7\n\nCheck if these x-values are \u2265 -4. Since \u221a7 \u2248 2.645 and -\u221a7 \u2248 -2.645, both are greater than -4. So valid.\n\nCase 2: x < -4. Then f(x) = x + 3. Set this equal to 3:\n\nx + 3 = 3\nx = 0\n\nBut x = 0 is not less than -4, so this solution is invalid here. So from f(x) = 3, we get x = \u221a7 and x = -\u221a7.\n\nNext, solve f(x) = -3.\n\nAgain, split into cases:\n\nCase 1: x \u2265 -4. Then f(x) = x\u00b2 - 4.

So, the function f(x) is defined piecewise, and I need to find how many values of x make f(f(x)) equal to 5. Hmm, piecewise functions can sometimes be tricky, especially when dealing with compositions. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall that f(f(x)) means I have to apply the function f twice. So, first compute f(x), and then apply f again to the result. The goal is to find all x such that this composition equals 5. Alright, let's start by understanding the function f(x) better.\n\nThe function f(x) is defined as:\n- If x is greater than or equal to -4, then f(x) = x\u00b2 - 4.\n- Otherwise, if x is less than -4, then f(x) = x + 3.\n\nSo, f(x) behaves differently depending on whether x is in the interval [-4, \u221e) or (-\u221e, -4). Similarly, when we compute f(f(x)), we need to consider the result of f(x) first and then apply the function f again based on where the result falls in the domain of f.\n\nThis seems like a two-step process. Let me structure it:\n\n1. Find all z such that f(z) = 5. This will give me the possible values of f(x) that need to be solved for z, where z is f(x). So, solving f(z) = 5 gives me z, and then I need to solve f(x) = z for each such z.\n\n2. For each solution z, find all x such that f(x) = z. Combine all these x values from each z.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Step 1: Solve f(z) = 5 to find possible z values.\n- Step 2: For each z, solve f(x) = z to find corresponding x values.\n- Step 3: Collect all unique x values from both z solutions.\n\nLet me start with Step 1: Solve f(z) = 5.\n\nTo solve f(z) = 5, I need to consider the definition of f(z). Depending on whether z is \u2265 -4 or < -4, the expression for f(z) changes.\n\nCase 1: If z \u2265 -4, then f(z) = z\u00b2 - 4. So, setting that equal to 5:\n\nz\u00b2 - 4 = 5 \u21d2 z\u00b2 = 9 \u21d2 z = 3 or z = -3. Since in this case, z \u2265 -4, both 3 and -3 are valid solutions because -3 \u2265 -4. So, in this case, z = 3 or z = -3.\n\nCase 2: If z < -4, then f(z) = z + 3. Setting that equal to 5:\n\nz + 3 = 5 \u21d2 z = 2. But this is a problem because z = 2 is not less than -4. So, in this case, there are no solutions. Hence, the only solutions to f(z) = 5 are z = 3 and z = -3.\n\nTherefore, Step 1 gives us two values for z: 3 and -3.\n\nNow, moving to Step 2: For each z (3 and -3), solve f(x) = z.\n\nSo, we need to solve f(x) = 3 and f(x) = -3 separately, and then collect all solutions x from both equations.\n\nLet me start with solving f(x) = 3.\n\nAgain, depending on whether x \u2265 -4 or x < -4, the expression for f(x) is different.\n\nCase 1: If x \u2265 -4, then f(x) = x\u00b2 - 4 = 3. Solving this:\n\nx\u00b2 - 4 = 3 \u21d2 x\u00b2 = 7 \u21d2 x = \u221a7 or x = -\u221a7. Both \u221a7 and -\u221a7 are greater than or equal to -4, so both are valid solutions here.\n\nCase 2: If x < -4, then f(x) = x + 3 = 3. Solving this:\n\nx + 3 = 3 \u21d2 x = 0. But 0 is not less than -4, so this is invalid in this case. Hence, no solutions here.\n\nTherefore, the solutions to f(x) = 3 are x = \u221a7 and x = -\u221a7.\n\nNext, solving f(x) = -3.\n\nAgain, check both cases.\n\nCase 1: If x \u2265 -4, then f(x) = x\u00b2 - 4 = -3.

Got it. Then, we need to find the number of x such that f(f(x)) = 5. Hmm. That means I need to figure out all x where when you plug x into f, the result is some value y, and then plugging y back into f gives 5. In other words, f(f(x)) = 5 implies that f(x) must be a value that when passed through f again gives 5. So first, let me find all possible y such that f(y) = 5, and then find all x such that f(x) equals those y values.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because f(f(x)) = 5 implies that f(x) must be a solution to f(y) = 5, and then f(x) has to be those y's. So first step: solve f(y) = 5 for y. Let me do that.\n\nSo f(y) = 5. Let's consider both cases of the piecewise function.\n\nCase 1: y \u2265 -4. Then f(y) = y\u00b2 - 4. So set that equal to 5:\n\ny\u00b2 - 4 = 5\ny\u00b2 = 9\ny = \u00b13\n\nBut we have to check if y \u2265 -4. Both 3 and -3 are greater than -4, so both are valid solutions in this case.\n\nCase 2: y < -4. Then f(y) = y + 3. Set that equal to 5:\n\ny + 3 = 5\ny = 2\n\nBut 2 is not less than -4, so this solution is invalid here. So in total, the solutions for f(y) = 5 are y = 3 and y = -3.\n\nTherefore, f(f(x)) = 5 implies that f(x) must be either 3 or -3. So now, I need to solve f(x) = 3 and f(x) = -3, and find all x that satisfy either equation, then count the total number of solutions.\n\nLet me handle f(x) = 3 first.\n\nSolving f(x) = 3:\n\nAgain, split into two cases based on the piecewise definition.\n\nCase 1: x \u2265 -4. Then f(x) = x\u00b2 - 4 = 3.\n\nx\u00b2 - 4 = 3\nx\u00b2 = 7\nx = \u00b1\u221a7\n\nSince \u221a7 \u2248 2.6458, which is greater than -4, so both solutions are valid here.\n\nCase 2: x < -4. Then f(x) = x + 3 = 3.\n\nx + 3 = 3\nx = 0\n\nBut 0 is not less than -4, so this solution is invalid. Therefore, the solutions for f(x) = 3 are x = \u221a7 and x = -\u221a7.\n\nNow let's solve f(x) = -3.\n\nSolving f(x) = -3:\n\nAgain, split into cases.\n\nCase 1: x \u2265 -4. Then f(x) = x\u00b2 - 4 = -3.\n\nx\u00b2 - 4 = -3\nx\u00b2 = 1\nx = \u00b11\n\nCheck if these are \u2265 -4. Both 1 and -1 are greater than -4, so both are valid here.\n\nCase 2: x < -4. Then f(x) = x + 3 = -3.\n\nx + 3 = -3\nx = -6\n\nCheck if x < -4. -6 is less than -4, so this solution is valid here.\n\nTherefore, the solutions for f(x) = -3 are x = 1, x = -1, and x = -6.\n\nNow, compiling all solutions from f(x) = 3 and f(x) = -3:\n\nFrom f(x) = 3: x = \u221a7, x = -\u221a7\n\nFrom f(x) = -3: x = 1, x = -1, x = -6\n\nSo total solutions are 2 + 3 = 5.

The function f(x) is piecewise defined, so for each part of the problem, I need to check both cases where x is greater than or equal to -4 and where x is less than -4. The question is asking for the number of values of x such that f(f(x)) = 5. Let me break this down into manageable parts.\n\nFirst, let me recall that f(f(x)) means applying the function f twice: first to x, then to the result. So, to find when f(f(x)) = 5, I need to find all x such that f(f(x)) = 5. This involves solving the equation f(y) = 5 where y = f(x). Therefore, I can first solve for y such that f(y) = 5, and then solve for x such that f(x) = y. The solutions will be all x that lead to such y.\n\nLet's start by solving f(y) = 5. Since f is piecewise, we need to consider two cases for y:\n\n**Case 1: y \u2265 -4**  \nIn this case, f(y) = y\u00b2 - 4. So, set y\u00b2 - 4 = 5.  \nSolving this: y\u00b2 = 9 \u21d2 y = 3 or y = -3. Both 3 and -3 are \u2265 -4, so they are valid solutions in this case.\n\n**Case 2: y < -4**  \nIn this case, f(y) = y + 3. So, set y + 3 = 5.  \nSolving this: y = 2. But y = 2 is not < -4, so this solution is invalid in this case.\n\nTherefore, the valid solutions for y are y = 3 and y = -3.\n\nNow, I need to find x such that f(x) = y, where y is either 3 or -3. So, we need to solve f(x) = 3 and f(x) = -3.\n\nLet me handle each equation separately.\n\n**First, solving f(x) = 3:**\n\nAgain, this is a piecewise function, so we split into two cases.\n\n**Subcase 1: x \u2265 -4**  \nHere, f(x) = x\u00b2 - 4. Set x\u00b2 - 4 = 3 \u21d2 x\u00b2 = 7 \u21d2 x = \u221a7 or x = -\u221a7. Both \u221a7 \u2248 2.6458 and -\u221a7 \u2248 -2.6458 are \u2265 -4, so both solutions are valid.\n\n**Subcase 2: x < -4**  \nHere, f(x) = x + 3. Set x + 3 = 3 \u21d2 x = 0. But x = 0 is not < -4, so this solution is invalid.\n\nThus, the solutions for f(x) = 3 are x = \u221a7 and x = -\u221a7.\n\n**Next, solving f(x) = -3:**\n\nAgain, split into two cases.\n\n**Subcase 1: x \u2265 -4**  \nHere, f(x) = x\u00b2 - 4. Set x\u00b2 - 4 = -3 \u21d2 x\u00b2 = 1 \u21d2 x = 1 or x = -1. Both 1 and -1 are \u2265 -4, so valid.\n\n**Subcase 2: x < -4**  \nHere, f(x) = x + 3. Set x + 3 = -3 \u21d2 x = -6. Now, check if x = -6 is < -4. Yes, -6 < -4, so this is a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the solutions for f(x) = -3 are x = 1, x = -1, and x = -6.\n\nNow, let's compile all the solutions we found:\n\nFrom f(x) = 3: x = \u221a7, x = -\u221a7\n\nFrom f(x) = -3: x = 1, x = -1, x = -6\n\nSo, all solutions for x are \u221a7, -\u221a7, 1, -1, -6.\n\nWait, that's five values. Let me check if there's any overlap or if any of these solutions actually lead to f(f(x)) \u2260 5. For example, maybe some x values when plugged into f(x) leads to a y that was invalid for f(y). But since we already considered the domains in both steps, each solution from f(x) = 3 and f(x) = -3 should correspond to valid y and hence lead to f(f(x)) = 5.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me verify each solution.\n\nTake x = \u221a7:\n\nFirst, f(\u221a7) = (\u221a7)\u00b2 - 4", 0.47999998927116394], ["35", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Now, we need to find all x such that when we apply f twice, we get 5. That is, f(f(x)) = 5. So, this means we first compute f(x), then apply f again to that result and set it equal to 5.\n\nTo approach this, I think the best way is to first solve for y such that f(y) = 5, and then solve for x such that f(x) = y. Because f(f(x)) = 5 implies there's some y where f(x) = y and then f(y) = 5. So, this becomes a two-step process: first find all possible y that lead to f(y) = 5, then for each such y, find all x that lead to f(x) = y. Then, the total number of solutions is the sum of solutions for each y. Let me verify if this approach is correct. Yeah, by the composition of functions, f(f(x)) = 5 is equivalent to finding x such that f(x) is a solution to f(y) = 5. So, splitting into two steps makes sense.\n\nSo, first step: solve f(y) = 5.\n\nGiven f(y) = 5, which of the two cases applies? Since f(y) changes based on whether y is \u2265 -4 or not. Let's check both cases.\n\nCase 1: If y \u2265 -4, then f(y) = y\u00b2 - 4. Set that equal to 5:\n\ny\u00b2 - 4 = 5  \ny\u00b2 = 5 + 4  \ny\u00b2 = 9  \ny = \u00b13\n\nBut since we are in the case where y \u2265 -4, both y = 3 and y = -3 are valid here because -3 \u2265 -4. So, for Case 1, y = 3 and y = -3.\n\nCase 2: If y < -4, then f(y) = y + 3. Set that equal to 5:\n\ny + 3 = 5  \ny = 2\n\nBut wait, in this case, we assumed y < -4, but the solution y = 2 is not less than -4. Therefore, no solution in this case.\n\nTherefore, the solutions for f(y) = 5 are y = 3 and y = -3.\n\nSo, now we need to solve f(x) = 3 and f(x) = -3 separately, and then count all solutions.\n\nFirst, let's solve f(x) = 3.\n\nAgain, split into two cases based on the piecewise definition.\n\nCase 1: x \u2265 -4. Then f(x) = x\u00b2 - 4. Set equal to 3:\n\nx\u00b2 - 4 = 3  \nx\u00b2 = 7  \nx = \u00b1\u221a7\n\nSince \u221a7 \u2248 2.645, which is greater than -4. So both x = \u221a7 and x = -\u221a7 are valid here.\n\nCase 2: x < -4. Then f(x) = x + 3. Set equal to 3:\n\nx + 3 = 3  \nx = 0\n\nBut x = 0 is not less than -4. So this case gives no solutions.\n\nTherefore, the solutions for f(x) = 3 are x = \u221a7 and x = -\u221a7. That's two solutions.\n\nNext, solve f(x) = -3.\n\nAgain, split into two cases.\n\nCase 1: x \u2265 -4. Then f(x) = x\u00b2 - 4. Set equal to -3:\n\nx\u00b2 - 4 = -3  \nx\u00b2 = 1  \nx = \u00b11\n\nCheck if these are \u2265 -4. Both 1 and -1 are \u2265 -4, so valid.\n\nCase 2: x < -4. Then f(x) = x + 3.

The sum of its digits is a multiple of $3$.  What is Bob's favorite number?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Bob's favorite number is between 50 and 100. It has to satisfy three conditions: being a multiple of 11, not a multiple of 2, and the sum of its digits being a multiple of 3. Hmm, let's break this down one by one.\n\nFirst, the number is between 50 and 100. So, it's a two-digit number. Let me write down all the multiples of 11 in that range. Starting from 11*5=55, which is 55. Then 11*6=66, 11*7=77, 11*8=88, 11*9=99. So the multiples of 11 between 50 and 100 are 55, 66, 77, 88, and 99. Got that.\n\nNext, the number shouldn't be a multiple of 2. A multiple of 2 is an even number, which means the last digit has to be even. Let's check which of the numbers we just listed are even. 55: ends with 5, which is odd. 66: ends with 6, even. 77: ends with 7, odd. 88: ends with 8, even. 99: ends with 9, odd. So the numbers that are not multiples of 2 are 55, 77, and 99. So we can eliminate 66 and 88 from the list. That leaves us with 55, 77, 99.\n\nNow, the third condition is that the sum of the digits is a multiple of 3. Let's check each of these remaining numbers:\n\n1. 55: digits sum to 5 + 5 = 10. 10 divided by 3 is not an integer. So 10 is not a multiple of 3. So 55 is out.\n\n2. 77: digits sum to 7 + 7 = 14. 14 divided by 3 is approximately 4.666... Not an integer, so 14 isn't a multiple of 3. So 77 is out.\n\n3. 99: digits sum to 9 + 9 = 18. 18 divided by 3 is exactly 6. So 18 is a multiple of 3. That works.\n\nTherefore, the only number left is 99. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake here. \n\nWait, let me confirm the steps again. First, multiples of 11 between 50-100: 55,66,77,88,99. Then exclude multiples of 2: which would be 66 and 88. So remaining numbers 55,77,99. Then check sum of digits: 5+5=10, 7+7=14, 9+9=18. 18 is the only one divisible by 3. So yes, 99 must be the answer. I think that's solid. Let me just check if 99 is indeed divisible by 11. 11*9=99, right? 11*9 is 99. Yep. And it's not even, so not a multiple of 2. Sum of digits is 18, which is divisible by 3. All conditions met. So, the answer is 99.\n\n**Final Answer**\nBob's favorite number is \\boxed{99}.\n</think>\n\nBob's favorite number is between 50 and 100.

So, Bob's favorite number is between 50 and 100. Let's note that down first: 50 < N < 100. The number has to be a multiple of 11, but not a multiple of 2. Also, the sum of its digits needs to be a multiple of 3. We need to find all such numbers and see which one fits all the criteria.

To find these, I can start by dividing 50 by 11 to see where we start.\n\nCalculating 50 \u00f7 11 \u2248 4.545. So, the next whole number is 5. Therefore, 11 \u00d7 5 = 55. Let's check 11\u00d75=55. Then 11\u00d76=66, 11\u00d77=77, 11\u00d78=88, 11\u00d79=99. 11\u00d710=110, which is over 100.

Since even numbers are multiples of 2, we need to eliminate any even numbers from our list. Looking at our multiples of 11: 55, 66, 77, 88, 99. Let's check each:\n\n- 55: 55 \u00f7 2 = 27.5, so it's odd. Good.\n- 66: 66 \u00f7 2 = 33, it's even. Cross this out.\n- 77: 77 \u00f7 2 = 38.5, odd. Good.\n- 88: 88 \u00f7 2 = 44, even. Cross this out.\n- 99: 99 \u00f7 2 = 49.5, odd. Good.\n\nSo now our candidates are 55, 77, and 99.\n\nNow, the last condition is that the sum of its digits is a multiple of 3. Let's compute the sum for each remaining number:\n\n- 55: 5 + 5 = 10. 10 \u00f7 3 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so not a multiple of 3.\n- 77: 7 + 7 = 14. 14 \u00f7 3 is 4 with a remainder of 2, not a multiple of 3.\n- 99: 9 + 9 = 18. 18 \u00f7 3 = 6 exactly. So this is a multiple of 3.\n\nTherefore, the only number that satisfies all three conditions is 99.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFirst step: found all multiples of 11 between 50-100. Correct: 55,66,77,88,99.\n\nSecond step: eliminated even numbers. 55,77,99 remained. Correct.\n\nThird step: sum of digits. For 55, sum is 10, not multiple of 3. For 77, sum is 14, not multiple of 3. For 99, sum is 18, which is exactly 3\u00d76. So yes, 99 is the only one. Therefore, Bob's favorite number is 99.\n\n**Final Answer**\nBob's favorite number is \\boxed{99}.\n</think>\n\nBob's favorite number is between 50 and 100.

The sum of its digits is a multiple of $3$.  What is Bob's favorite number?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out Bob's favorite number step by step. First, the problem says that his favorite number is between 50 and 100. So we need to check all numbers from 51 to 99. Then, it has to be a multiple of 11 but not a multiple of 2. Hmm, so that means it must be an even number first, then check if it's a multiple of 11, and then exclude any that are also even (since they would be multiples of 2). Wait, actually, the problem says \"not a multiple of 2,\" so maybe that means the number is not even. Let me check: the problem states, \"a multiple of 11, but not a multiple of 2.\" So the number must be divisible by 11 but not by 2. So that's important. So the number is odd, because if it were even, it would be divisible by both 11 and 2, which would make it a multiple of 22. Therefore, instead of checking multiples of 11, maybe I can look for numbers between 50 and 100 that are multiples of 11 and then check if they are not multiples of 2. Alternatively, since the number must be odd, maybe list all multiples of 11 between 50 and 100 and see which ones are odd.\n\nLet me list the multiples of 11 between 50 and 100 first. Let's start with 11*5=55, then 11*6=66, 11*7=77, 11*8=88, 11*9=99. So the multiples of 11 in that range are 55, 66, 77, 88, 99. Now, exclude the ones that are multiples of 2. Multiples of 2 are even numbers. Let's check each of these:\n\n- 55: Last digit is 5, odd. So not a multiple of 2. So keep this.\n- 66: Last digit is 6, even. So exclude.\n- 77: Last digit is 7, odd. Keep.\n- 88: Last digit is 8, even. Exclude.\n- 99: Last digit is 9, odd. Keep.\n\nSo the candidates are 55, 77, 99. Now, the next condition is that the sum of its digits is a multiple of 3. Let's check each candidate:\n\n- 55: 5 + 5 = 10. 10 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder of 1. Not a multiple of 3. So exclude.\n- 77: 7 + 7 = 14. 14 divided by 3 is 4 with a remainder of 2. Not a multiple of 3. Exclude.\n- 99: 9 + 9 = 18. 18 divided by 3 is 6, which is a whole number. So 18 is a multiple of 3. Therefore, 99 satisfies all conditions.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Bob's favorite number is 99. Let me just double-check all the conditions to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nIs 99 between 50 and 100? Yes. Is it a multiple of 11? 99 \u00f7 11 = 9, so yes. Is it not a multiple of 2? 99 is odd, so yes. The sum of its digits is 9 + 9 = 18, which is a multiple of 3. So all conditions are met. Therefore, the answer should be 99.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{99}\n</think>\n\nBob's favorite number is between 50 and 100, is a multiple of 11, not a multiple of 2, and the sum of its digits is a multiple of 3. \n\nFirst, we list the multiples of 11 between 50 and 100: 55, 66, 77, 88, 99.

So, the number is between 50 and 100, right? Let me note that down. The first condition is it's a multiple of 11. That might narrow it down a bit. Then, it's not a multiple of 2, so that means it has to be odd. Also, the sum of its digits is a multiple of 3. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list all the multiples of 11 between 50 and 100. Starting from 50, the multiples of 11 would be 55, 66, 77, 88, 99. Let me check that. 11 times 5 is 55, 11 times 6 is 66, 11 times 7 is 77, 11 times 8 is 88, 11 times 9 is 99. Yep, those are all the multiples of 11 in that range. So there are five possible numbers: 55, 66, 77, 88, 99.\n\nBut wait, the number can't be a multiple of 2. Since 66 and 88 are even numbers (because their last digits are 6 and 8), we can eliminate those. So now we have 55, 77, 99 left. Those are the numbers that meet the first two conditions: they're multiples of 11 and odd.\n\nNext step is to check the sum of their digits. Let's do each one:\n\n- 55: The sum is 5 + 5 = 10. 10 is not a multiple of 3. So 55 is out.\n- 77: The sum is 7 + 7 = 14. 14 is also not a multiple of 3. So 77 is out.\n- 99: The sum is 9 + 9 = 18. 18 is a multiple of 3 because 18 divided by 3 is 6. So that works.\n\nTherefore, the only number that satisfies all three conditions is 99. Let me just double-check everything to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The multiples of 11 between 50 and 100: 55, 66, 77, 88, 99. Eliminate even numbers: 66 and 88. Sum of digits: 55 is 10, 77 is 14, 99 is 18. 18 is divisible by 3. So yes, 99 is the answer. I think that's correct. No other numbers in the range meet all the criteria.

The sum of its digits is a multiple of $3$.  What is Bob's favorite number?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to find Bob's favorite number, which is between 50 and 100, satisfies several conditions: it's a multiple of 11, not a multiple of 2, and the sum of its digits is a multiple of 3. Let me break down each requirement and see how they interact.\n\nFirst, the number must be between 50 and 100. So, we're looking for a two-digit number where the tens digit is 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, and the units digit is 0-9. Got that.\n\nNext, the number is a multiple of 11. Let me recall that there's a divisibility rule for 11: a number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions is a multiple of 11 (including zero). Since we're dealing with two-digit numbers, the positions are the tens digit (first position) and the units digit (second position). So, the rule here simplifies to (sum of digits in odd positions) - (sum of digits in even positions). Since there are two digits, odd positions is the first digit and even positions is the second digit. The difference between the first digit and the second digit should be a multiple of 11.\n\nWait, let me verify that. For a two-digit number, say AB, the difference is (A - B). For the number to be divisible by 11, (A - B) must be 0, 11, or -11. But since A and B are digits (0-9), the difference (A - B) can only be between -9 and 9. So, the only possible differences that are multiples of 11 are 0 and 11. But 11 is impossible because the maximum difference is 9 (if A=9 and B=0). So, the only possibility is (A - B) = 0. Therefore, the number must have equal digits. Wait, hold on. Let me check this again.\n\nWait, actually, the rule is that (A - B) must be a multiple of 11. Since A and B are digits, (A - B) can only be 0, 11, or -11. But since A and B are single digits, the maximum difference is 9 (if A=9 and B=0) and the minimum is -9 (if A=0 and B=9). Therefore, the only possible value for (A - B) that's a multiple of 11 is 0. So, A must equal B? Wait, that would mean numbers like 11, 22, ..., 99. But let me confirm this with an example. Take 21. The difference is 2 - 1 = 1, which is not a multiple of 11. 34: 3-4 = -1, nope. 99: 9-9=0, which is a multiple of 11. So yes, the two-digit multiples of 11 are numbers where the two digits are the same. So, 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99.\n\nBut the problem says the number is a multiple of 11 but not a multiple of 2. So, if the number is a two-digit multiple of 11, and it's not a multiple of 2, then it's an odd number. Therefore, its units digit must be odd. So, looking at the multiples of 11: 11, 33, 55, 77, 99. These end with an odd digit. So possible candidates are 55, 77, 99? Wait, but let's confirm. 11 is 11, which is odd, 22 is even, 33 odd, 44 even, 55 odd, 66 even, 77 odd, 88 even, 99 odd. So the multiples of 11 that are odd between 50 and 100 are 55, 77, 99. Wait, 55 is 55, which is between 50 and 100. 77 is 77, and 99 is 99. So those three numbers.\n\nBut the problem states Bob's favorite number is between 50 and 100, so 55, 77, 99.

Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, let's list all the multiples of 11 between 50 and 100. Since 11 times 5 is 55, 11 times 6 is 66, 11 times 7 is 77, 11 times 8 is 88, and 11 times 9 is 99. So the multiples of 11 in this range are 55, 66, 77, 88, and 99. Now, the next condition is that it's not a multiple of 2. Let me check each of these numbers to see if any of them are even. If a number is a multiple of 2, its last digit is even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8). Looking at the list:\n\n- 55 ends with 5, which is odd. So 55 is not even. Good, not eliminated yet.\n- 66 ends with 6, which is even. So 66 is out.\n- 77 ends with 7, which is odd. So 77 is still in.\n- 88 ends with 8, which is even. Out.\n- 99 ends with 9, which is odd. So 99 remains.\n\nSo after the first two conditions, we're left with 55, 77, and 99. Now, the next condition is that the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 3. Let's check each remaining candidate:\n\n1. 55: The digits are 5 and 5. Sum is 5 + 5 = 10. Is 10 a multiple of 3? Well, 3 times 3 is 9, and 3 times 4 is 12. 10 is in between. So 10 isn't a multiple of 3. So 55 is out.\n\n2. 77: Digits are 7 and 7. Sum is 7 + 7 = 14. 14 divided by 3 is about 4.666..., which isn't an integer. So 14 isn't a multiple of 3. Therefore, 77 is eliminated.\n\n3. 99: Digits are 9 and 9. Sum is 9 + 9 = 18. 18 divided by 3 is 6, which is an integer. So 18 is a multiple of 3. That checks out.\n\nSo after all the conditions, the only number left is 99. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 99 is between 50 and 100. It's a multiple of 11 (since 11*9=99). It's not even because it ends with 9. The sum of its digits is 9+9=18, which is divisible by 3.

So Bob has a favorite number between 50 and 100. Let me break down the requirements:\n\n1. It's a multiple of 11.\n2. It's not a multiple of 2 (so it's odd).\n3. The sum of its digits is a multiple of 3.\n\nFirst, I need to find all numbers between 50 and 100 that are multiples of 11. Then, eliminate those that are even, and finally check which of the remaining has digits that add up to a multiple of 3. Let me start by listing the multiples of 11 in that range.\n\nStarting from 11, the multiples are: 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 110... but wait, 110 is outside the upper limit of 100. So up to 99. But the range is between 50 and 100, so starting from 50. Let's check each multiple of 11 in this range.\n\nFirst, the multiples of 11 greater than or equal to 50: \n\n55 (since 11*5=55), 66 (11*6=66), 77 (11*7=77), 88 (11*8=88), 99 (11*9=99). 110 is over 100, so we can stop here.\n\nSo possible candidates are 55, 66, 77, 88, 99. But the number can't be a multiple of 2. Let's check which of these are even.\n\n55 is odd (ends with 5), 66 is even (ends with 6), 77 is odd (ends with 7), 88 is even (ends with 8), 99 is odd (ends with 9). So we eliminate the even ones: 66 and 88. The remaining candidates are 55, 77, 99.\n\nNow, let's check the sum of the digits of each remaining number to see if it's a multiple of 3.\n\nFor 55: 5 + 5 = 10. 10 isn't a multiple of 3 (since 3*3=9, 3*4=12). So 10 is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 55 is out.\n\nFor 77: 7 + 7 = 14. 14 divided by 3 is 4 with a remainder of 2, so 14 is not a multiple of 3. Therefore, 77 is out.\n\nWait, so now both 55 and 77 don't satisfy the digit sum condition. Then our last candidate is 99.\n\nCheck 99: 9 + 9 = 18. 18 is a multiple of 3 (3*6=18). So 99 meets all the conditions.\n\nTherefore, Bob's favorite number must be 99. Let me just verify all steps once more to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1.

Hmm, let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize this. There's a circle, radius 4. We need to fit it inside a square such that all parts of the circle are within the square, and the square is as small as possible. Since we want the smallest square, we need to figure out the side length of the square that can just barely contain the circle.\n\nLet me recall that the diameter of a circle is twice the radius. So, if the radius is 4, the diameter should be 4*2 = 8. That makes sense. The diameter is the distance across the circle passing through the center, so that's the longest distance between any two points on the circle.\n\nNow, when you want to fit a circle inside a square, the most efficient way in terms of area is when the circle is inscribed within the square. That is, the circle touches the square at its midpoints of the sides. In this case, the diameter of the circle should be equal to the side length of the square. Because if the diameter is equal to the side, then the circle touches the square at the midpoints, and thus the square just barely contains the circle without any leftover space on that side.\n\nWait, but let me verify that. If the diameter is 8, then the side length of the square must be 8 as well. So the area of the square would be 8 squared, which is 64. Is that correct?\n\nBut I should check if there's a scenario where a smaller square could contain the circle. Maybe if the circle is placed diagonally within the square? Hmm, but if we place it diagonally, the diagonal of the square would have to be at least equal to the diameter of the circle. Let me explore that.\n\nThe formula for the diagonal of a square is side length multiplied by the square root of 2. So, if we let 's' be the side length of the square, then the diagonal is s\u221a2. If we set this equal to the diameter of the circle, which is 8, then s\u221a2 = 8. Solving for s gives s = 8 / \u221a2. Simplifying that, s = (8\u221a2) / 2 = 4\u221a2. Then the area would be s squared, so (4\u221a2)^2 = 16 * 2 = 32. Wait, that's smaller than 64. But this seems contradictory because if the circle is placed diagonally in the square, the square is smaller? But how does that work?\n\nWait, let me think again. If the circle is placed diagonally inside the square, so that the circle touches all four sides of the square, then the diameter of the circle would be equal to the diagonal of the square. But in that case, the square's diagonal is 8, so as we calculated, the side length is 4\u221a2, which is approximately 5.656, so the area is 32. But is that correct?\n\nBut here's the confusion: if the circle is placed diagonally inside the square, touching all four sides, then the square must have a side length equal to the diameter divided by \u221a2, as above. However, in reality, when arranging a circle inside a square, if you rotate it by 45 degrees, the circle would require the square to be at least as large as the diagonal. So in that case, the area would be smaller. But which one is the correct way to fit the circle into the square?\n\nThis is probably a matter of how exactly you fit the circle into the square. If you rotate the circle to fit inside the square diagonally, then the square's side length is smaller than just the diameter. But is that possible?\n\nWait, let's clarify. If we have a square with side length s, and we want to fit a circle of radius r inside it. The minimal square that can fit a circle of radius r must have side length equal to 2r if the circle is axis-aligned. But if we rotate the circle by 45 degrees, then the minimal square required would be the one whose diagonal is 2r. Therefore, the side length would be (2r)/\u221a2 = r\u221a2. So in this case, with radius 4, the side length would be 4\u221a2, and the area is (4\u221a2)^2 = 32. But this contradicts my initial thought that the side length would be 8.\n\nSo now I'm confused. Which one is correct? Let me verify with numbers. Let's take a circle with radius 4. If I place it in a square where the square is axis-aligned, then the square must have side length 8, area 64.

The problem is asking for the area of the smallest square that can contain a circle with radius 4. Hmm, I need to figure out the dimensions of the square first, right? If the square has to contain the entire circle without leaving any gaps, then the square must be large enough to fit the circle inside it.\n\nSo, the circle has a radius of 4. Let me recall that the radius is half of the diameter. Therefore, the diameter of this circle would be 2 times 4, which is 8. That means the circle is 8 units in diameter. \n\nNow, how does the diameter of the circle relate to the square that needs to contain it? Well, if I want to fit the circle into the square, the circle's diameter has to be less than or equal to the side length of the square. Otherwise, the circle would stick out of the square. So, the smallest square that can contain the circle must have sides that are at least as long as the diameter of the circle. \n\nWait, but is that the case? Let me visualize this. If the circle is inscribed in the square, meaning it touches the square at all four sides, then the diameter of the circle would be equal to the side length of the square. Yes, that makes sense. So, if the diameter is 8, the side length of the square should also be 8. Therefore, the area of the square would be side length squared, which is 8 times 8, equal to 64.\n\nBut hold on, let me double-check. Suppose the square is just slightly smaller than 8, say 7.9. Then the diameter of the circle is 8, which is longer than 7.9, so the circle wouldn't fit inside the square. Therefore, the square needs to be exactly 8 units on each side to contain the circle. So the area would indeed be 8x8=64.\n\nIs there another way to think about this? Maybe considering coordinates. If the circle is centered at the center of the square, the maximum distance from the center to any point on the circle is the radius 4, so from the center to the edge of the circle is 4. Similarly, from the center to the edge of the square must also be at least 4. But since the square extends from edge to edge, the distance from center to the edge is half the side length. So half the side length must be at least 4. Therefore, the whole side length must be at least 8. Yep, same result.\n\nI think that's solid. The key idea is that the circle must fit within the square such that the square's sides are equal to or longer than the circle's diameter. Since the diameter is twice the radius, and the radius is 4, the diameter is 8. Therefore, the square must have sides of length 8, leading to an area of 64.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe area of the smallest square is \\boxed{64}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the area of the smallest square that will contain a circle of radius 4, we start by determining the diameter of the circle. The diameter is twice the radius, so:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Diameter} = 2 \\times 4 = 8\n\\]\n\nThe smallest square that can contain the circle must have sides equal to the diameter of the circle.

We need to find all rational (x, y) such that this equation holds. \n\nFirst, let me recall that a rational point on a circle of radius r centered at (h, k) is a solution to (x - h)\u00b2 + (y - k)\u00b2 = r\u00b2 where x and y are rational.

Hmm, let me start by visualizing this. A square that fits a circle inside it... I remember that for the square to be the smallest possible, the circle should fit perfectly inside, right? So, the diameter of the circle would have to match the side length of the square. Let me check my reasoning here.\n\nFirst, the radius of the circle is given as 4. If the radius is 4, then the diameter would be twice the radius, which is 8. So, the diameter of the circle is 8 units. Now, if the square needs to contain this circle, the diameter of the circle should be equal to the length of the square's side. That makes sense because if the circle was any bigger, it wouldn't fit inside the square. So, the side length of the square should be 8 units to just contain the circle.\n\nThen, to find the area of the square, I just need to square its side length. So, 8 squared is 64. Therefore, the area of the square should be 64 square units. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Sometimes, problems can trick you by having circles inside squares of different orientations, but in this case, the smallest square would indeed have sides equal to the circle's diameter. \n\nWait, another way to think about it: if the circle is perfectly inscribed in the square, the diagonal of the square would actually be related to the radius if the circle was inscribed such that the center is at the square's center and the circle touches the sides. But no, in the case where the square is smallest to contain the circle, the circle is inscribed in the square, meaning the diameter equals the side length. If the circle was inscribed in the square, like touching all sides, then the side length is the diameter. So, yes, that seems right.\n\nLet me recap to ensure there's no error. Given radius r = 4, diameter d = 2r = 8. The square's side length must equal the diameter to fit the circle snugly. Area of square is side length squared, so 8\u00b2 = 64. Therefore, the area is 64.  \n</think>\n\nThe smallest square that contains a circle of radius 4 must have its side length equal to the circle's diameter.

The question is asking for the natural number \\( n \\) that satisfies the equation \\( n^2 + 3\\sqrt{n + 1} = 95 \\). The options given are pairs of numbers, so I need to find out which pair fits correctly. Let me start by understanding the equation and breaking it down.\n\nFirst, let's note that \\( n \\) is a natural number, which means it's a positive integer (1, 2, 3, ...). The equation involves both \\( n^2 \\) and \\( \\sqrt{n + 1} \\). To solve for \\( n \\), maybe I can try squaring both sides to eliminate the square root, but I have to be careful because squaring can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions.

Hmm, let's think step by step. First, I should visualize the problem. There's a circle with radius 4, and I need to fit the smallest possible square around it. The square has to be placed around the circle such that the circle just touches all sides of the square without overlapping. That makes sense because if it's overlapping, then maybe the square could be smaller, but since we want the smallest possible, it should just touch the circle at its maximum points.\n\nAlright, so the key here is to figure out the side length of the square. If the circle is inscribed in the square, meaning it touches all four sides of the square, then the diameter of the circle would be equal to the side length of the square. The diameter is twice the radius, so if the radius is 4, the diameter is 8. Therefore, the side length of the square should be 8. Then, the area of the square would be side squared, which is 8 squared.\n\nLet me check if that makes sense. If the circle has a radius of 4, then from the center of the circle to any side is 4 units. So, the center is in the middle of the square. The distance from one side of the square to the opposite side is 8, which is the diameter. So yes, the square needs to be 8 units on each side. Therefore, the area would be 8 multiplied by 8, which is 64. So the area should be 64.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me confirm again. Sometimes problems can be tricky. For example, if the circle wasn't inscribed but was instead placed such that it touches the square at different points. But in this case, the smallest square that can contain a circle would have the circle inscribed. If we tried to place the circle in a smaller square, wouldn't the square have to be larger? Because the circle touches the square at the edges. If the square were smaller, the circle would stick out. So the inscribed case gives the smallest possible square.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using coordinates. Let's place the center of the circle at the center of the square. Then, the coordinates of the center would be (4, 4) if the square is from (0,0) to (8,8). The circle with radius 4 would extend from 0 to 8 in both x and y directions, touching all four sides. So, yes, the square must have a side length of 8, area 64.\n\nI don't think there's any other configuration here. The minimal square must have sides equal to the diameter of the circle when placed in such a way. If it were placed diagonally, the diagonal of the square would need to be at least the diameter of the circle. Wait, but in that case, if we rotate the square, the sides would be longer. Let me check that.\n\nSuppose we rotate the square so that the circle is inscribed within it but not at the center. Then, the square would have sides that are longer. For example, if we place the circle in one corner, the square needs to extend from the corner to cover the circle. The distance from the corner to the farthest point of the circle would be the radius times sqrt(2), which is 4*sqrt(2) \u2248 5.656. So the side length would need to be approximately 5.656, which is less than 8. But that contradicts our previous conclusion.\n\nWait, so this approach is different. If you rotate the square, you can actually fit the circle into a smaller square. So which one is correct? This is confusing.\n\nHold on, maybe I need to clarify: the problem says the circle must be contained within the square. Does it mean that the circle must be entirely inside the square, or that the square must contain the circle, which could be anywhere inside the square? The problem statement says \"contain,\" so I think it simply means that the square must be positioned such that the circle is entirely within it. So the square can be rotated, but the circle must fit inside without any part of the circle sticking out.\n\nSo in this case, the minimal square's side length would be determined by the maximum distance across the circle in any direction. The maximum distance is the diameter (8) if the square is aligned with the circle, but if we rotate the square, the diagonal would actually require a larger square. Wait, no. Wait, if the circle is centered in the square, when rotated, the diagonal of the square would need to encompass the circle. Let's calculate that.\n\nIf the circle is at the center, and we rotate the square by 45 degrees, the diagonal of the square would have to be such that the corners", 0.46000000834465027], ["35", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

The problem is asking for the area of the smallest square that can contain a circle with radius 4. Hmm, right. So, I need to figure out the minimal square area required to fit this circle inside. Let me start by visualizing this. If the circle is inside the square, the square has to be large enough to cover the circle completely. Since a circle has no corners, the square will just touch the circle at some points, right?\n\nFirst, I remember that the diameter of a circle is twice the radius. So, if the radius is 4, the diameter would be 8. That makes sense. The diameter is the longest distance across the circle, so that should determine the size needed in both width and height of the square. Wait, but squares are symmetrical, so if the circle is centered inside the square, the square needs to be just as long as the diameter of the circle in both directions. Let me check that.\n\nIf the circle is inscribed in the square, then the square's sides would each be equal to the diameter of the circle. So, the side length of the square would be equal to the diameter, which is 2r. Since r is 4, that would make the side length 8. Then, the area of the square would be side length squared, which is 8 squared, so 64. Is that right?\n\nWait, let me confirm. If the circle is inscribed in the square, then the circle touches the square at the midpoints of each side. That means the diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square. Yes, that's correct. So, the area would indeed be 8 times 8, which is 64. So, the answer should be 64.\n\nBut let me make sure I haven't missed anything. The problem says \"the area of the smallest square that will contain a circle of radius 4.\" So, does that mean we can't rotate the square? Because if we rotate the square, maybe we can fit the circle in a smaller square? But no, the circle is symmetrical, and rotating it wouldn't change the required dimensions. The minimal square size is determined by the diameter of the circle. Therefore, rotating the square won't help. So, the answer is 64.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if there's another way to position the circle inside the square where a smaller square could contain it. For instance, if the circle is not centered, maybe the square could be smaller? But no, since the circle has a fixed radius, to contain it entirely, the square must encompass all parts of the circle. If the circle is not centered at the square's center, parts of the circle might extend beyond the edges of the square. Therefore, the circle must be centered to minimize the square's size. Hence, the diameter equals the side length.\n\nTherefore, the area is 8 squared, which is 64.

A circle with radius 4 would have a diameter of 8, right? Because the diameter is twice the radius. So if the circle has a diameter of 8, then the smallest square that can contain it would need to have sides equal to the diameter. Wait, is that correct? Let me check.\n\nIf I imagine a circle inside a square, the square needs to be as small as possible to just fit the circle. The most efficient way to fit a circle into a square is to have the circle touch the square at points where the circle's diameter is aligned with the square's sides. So the diameter of the circle would be equal to the length of the square's side. Therefore, the side length of the square should be 8, which is the diameter of the circle. \n\nBut let me verify this step by step. If the circle has radius 4, its diameter is indeed 8. The square's side needs to be at least as long as the diameter so that the circle can fit inside. If the square is smaller than the diameter, then the circle would protrude beyond the square's sides. So yes, the minimal side length of the square must be equal to the diameter of the circle. \n\nTherefore, the side length of the square is 8. Then the area would be side length squared. So 8 multiplied by 8 equals 64. Therefore, the area of the square should be 64. \n\nWait, just to make sure there isn't a trick here. The problem says \"smallest square that will contain a circle of radius 4.\" Are there any other configurations where the square can be smaller? For instance, if the circle is rotated at an angle inside the square? I think not. If the circle is rotated, the required square size would still need to cover the entire diameter in both directions. So rotating the circle won't make the square smaller; it might actually require a larger square because the diagonal of the square would need to accommodate the rotated circle. Wait, is that possible?\n\nLet me think again. Suppose the circle is rotated so that it's at 45 degrees relative to the square. Then the distance from the center of the circle to any corner of the square would be the square root of (4^2 + 4^2), which is sqrt(32) \u2248 5.656, but that's the distance from the center to the corner of the square. Wait, no, actually if the circle is rotated inside the square, the diagonal of the square would have to be at least equal to the circle's diameter. But if we rotate the square so that the circle is centered, then the square's diagonal must be equal to the circle's diameter. Wait, this is getting confusing.\n\nLet me recall: the diagonal of a square with side length s is s*sqrt(2). If we need to fit a circle of diameter 8 into that diagonal, then the diagonal of the square must be at least 8. Therefore, s*sqrt(2) = 8, so s = 8/sqrt(2) = 4*sqrt(2) \u2248 5.656. But wait, that's smaller than the diameter. But if you rotate the square, the circle would be smaller than needed? No, because the circle has a fixed diameter. So if the square is rotated, the required square size is still determined by the diameter. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up things here.\n\nAlternatively, if the circle is placed inside the square at any angle, the square must have sides at least as long as the circle's diameter because otherwise the circle would stick out. So regardless of how you place the circle inside the square (rotated or not), the minimal square must have sides of length equal to the diameter of the circle, which is 8. Therefore, the area is 8^2 = 64.\n\nTherefore, my initial reasoning seems correct. The minimal square must have sides equal to the diameter of the circle, so the area is 64.

So that might not help minimize the square.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal square is when the circle is inscribed in the square, meaning the square is just large enough to contain the circle with sides parallel to the square's sides. Because if you rotate the square, you might frees up space, but the axis-aligned square would give a larger area.\n\nWait, let me approach this methodically. Let's consider two cases: one where the square is axis-aligned and one where it's rotated.\n\nCase 1: Square is axis-aligned with the circle centered inside. Then the side length of the square must be equal to the diameter of the circle, which is 8, as the circle touches all four sides. The area would then be 8*8=64.\n\nCase 2: Square is rotated so that the diameter of the circle is along the diagonal of the square. In this case, the diagonal of the square would need to be equal to the diameter of the circle. Let me denote the side length of the rotated square as 'a'. Then, the diagonal of the square is a\u221a2. Setting this equal to the diameter of the circle (8), we have a\u221a2 = 8, so a = 8/\u221a2 = 4\u221a2. Then the area of the square is (4\u221a2)^2 = 16*2 = 32. Wait, 32 is smaller than 64. So in this case, the area is 32. So this would be a smaller square.\n\nBut hold on, is this possible? If I rotate the square by 45 degrees, the diagonal would fit the circle's diameter. But does the circle actually fit inside the rotated square? Let me check.\n\nImagine the square rotated so that its diagonal is along the circle's diameter. The circle's center would be at the center of the square. The distance from the center of the square to any corner of the square (which is the radius of the circle needed for the square to contain the circle) would be half the diagonal of the square, which is a\u221a2/2. If a\u221a2/2 must be greater than or equal to the radius of the circle, which is 4, then a\u221a2/2 >=4 => a >= 8/\u221a2 =4\u221a2. So yes, when a =4\u221a2, the distance from the center to the corners of the square is exactly 4\u221a2/2 =2\u221a2 \u22482.828,", 0.46000000834465027], ["35", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

The school wants the logo to be 8 inches wide, but they want it enlarged proportionately. Hmm, proportionally means keeping the same shape, right? So the width and height should increase by the same factor. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out by what factor the width is being enlarged. The original width is 2 inches, and they want it to be 8 inches. So I divide 8 by 2 to find the scale factor. That would be 8 \u00f7 2 = 4. Wait, so that means they're multiplying the width by 4. If the shape is maintained, multiplying the width by 4 should mean the same for the height.\n\nOriginal height is 1.5 inches. If I multiply that by the same scale factor, which is 4, then the new height should be 1.5 \u00d7 4. Let me calculate that. 1.5 times 4 is... 1.5 \u00d7 4 equals 6. So the new height would be 6 inches.\n\nBut let me check if I did everything right. Proportional resizing keeps the aspect ratio the same. The aspect ratio is width divided by height. Original aspect ratio is 2 \u00f7 1.5. Let me compute that. 2 divided by 1.5 is the same as 2 \u00f7 (3/2) which is 2 \u00d7 (2/3) = 4/3. So the aspect ratio is 4:3.\n\nAfter enlarging, the new width is 8 inches, so new height should be 8 \u00f7 (4/3) = 8 \u00d7 (3/4) = 6 inches. Yep, same result. So that checks out.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the original dimensions are 2 and 1.5. The new width is 8. The scale factor is 8/2 = 4. Therefore, each dimension is multiplied by 4. 1.5 \u00d7 4 = 6. Yep, that's consistent.

Right, this should be a proportion problem. Let me recall how proportions work.\n\nProportions are about maintaining the same ratio between the original and the enlarged dimensions. So if the width doubles, the height should also double, right? Wait, let me check. The original width is 2 inches, and they want it to be 8 inches. So how much do we need to multiply the width by? Let's see: 8 \u00f7 2 = 4. So the scale factor is 4. Therefore, each dimension should be multiplied by 4. So the original height was 1.5 inches, so the new height should be 1.5 \u00d7 4. Let me compute that. 1.5 times 4 is 6. So the height would be 6 inches. Let me confirm if this makes sense proportionally.\n\nOriginal dimensions: width 2, height 1.5. Ratio of height to width is 1.5/2 = 0.75. If we enlarge the width to 8, then the new height should be 0.75 times 8, which is also 6. Yep, that checks out.

But the school wants to make it bigger, specifically 8 inches wide. I need to figure out how tall it'll be if they enlarge it proportionately. Hmm, let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, proportional enlargement... that means the width and height should increase by the same factor, right? So if the original width is 2 inches and they want it to be 8 inches, I should find out how much bigger 8 is compared to 2. Let me calculate that. \n\nWait, 8 divided by 2 is 4. So that's 4 times as wide. Therefore, the height should also be multiplied by 4 to keep the proportions the same. Let me check the original height is 1.5 inches. If I multiply 1.5 by 4, what do I get?\n\n1.5 times 4. Let me do that multiplication. 1.5 times 4 is the same as 1.5 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 1.5. Each time I add 1.5, so 1.5*2 is 3, then 3 +1.5 is 4.5, and then 4.5 +1.5 is 6. So 1.5 times 4 equals 6. So the new height should be 6 inches. \n\nBut let me verify to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's check the proportions. Original ratio is width to height, 2:1.5. If we simplify that, dividing both by 2, we get 1:0.75. So the ratio is 1 to 0.75. If we scale the width up by a factor of 4, the new width is 8. Let's see what the scaling factor is for height. Original height is 1.5, so scaling factor would be 8/2 = 4. Therefore, scaling the original height by 4 gives 1.5*4=6. Yep, that's correct. \n\nWait, sometimes when dealing with proportions, people might confuse width and height scaling factors. Let me double-check. The width increases by 8/2 = 4 times, so the height should increase by 4 times as well. Original height is 1.5, 1.5*4=6. So the answer is 6 inches. \n\nI think that's right. Let me just confirm once more. If you have similar figures, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal. So, 2/1.5 = 8/h, where h is the new height. Solving for h: h = (8*1.5)/2. Let's compute that. 8*1.5 is 12, divided by 2 is 6. Yep, same result. \n\nSo, using cross-multiplication or recognizing the scaling factor both lead to the same answer. Therefore, the height should be 6 inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe enlarged logo will be \\boxed{6} inches tall.\n</think>\n\nAlexia designed a logo that is 2 inches wide and 1.5 inches tall.

So, the question is about resizing a logo proportionately. The original logo is 2 inches wide and 1.5 inches tall. They want to make it 8 inches wide. We need to find out how tall it will be when enlarged. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, let's recall that when something is enlarged proportionately, the ratio between the corresponding sides remains the same. So, the width and the height should both increase by the same factor. That means if the width goes from 2 inches to 8 inches, we need to find out by what factor this is multiplied and then apply that same factor to the height to get the new height.\n\nLet me write that down mathematically. The original width is 2 inches, and the new width is 8 inches. The scaling factor (how much we multiply the original dimensions by) would be the new width divided by the original width. So, scaling factor (k) = 8 inches / 2 inches = 4. So, it's being enlarged by a factor of 4.\n\nNow, since the enlargement is proportional, the height will also be multiplied by the same factor. The original height is 1.5 inches, so the new height should be 1.5 inches * 4. Let me calculate that: 1.5 * 4 = 6. So, the height becomes 6 inches.\n\nWait a second, let me check if that makes sense. If you double the width from 2 to 4 inches, the height would double to 3 inches. Then quadruple the width to 8 inches, so the height would quadruple to 6 inches. Yeah, that seems right. So, the height is 6 inches when enlarged proportionately.\n\nIs there another way to verify this? Maybe using cross-multiplication ratios. If the original width is 2 and the new width is 8, the ratio is 2:8, which simplifies to 1:4. Therefore, the height should also be in the ratio of 1:4, so 1.5 * (4/1) = 6. Yep, that checks out.\n\nI think that's solid. The key thing here is recognizing that proportionality means the ratios of corresponding sides must be equal. So, keeping the aspect ratio the same. Since the width is quadrupled, the height must also be quadrupled. No mistakes in the calculations here.

Let me write that down as an equation to visualize it better.\n\nOriginal ratio: width / height = 2 / 1.5\n\nNew ratio: 8 / height_new (let me call the new height h)\n\nSince they have to be proportional, these two ratios must be equal.

Let's check if the aspect ratio is preserved. The original aspect ratio is 2:1.5. If we divide both numbers by the same factor to get to 8 inches wide, we should multiply the original height by that same factor.

If the original height is 1.5 inches, then multiplying by 4 gives 1.5 * 4 = 6 inches. Yep, same answer. That makes sense. So both methods lead to h = 6 inches.

Let me see. The original logo is 2 inches wide and 1.5 inches tall. The school wants it enlarged to be 8 inches wide. The question is, how tall will it be if it's enlarged proportionately? Alright, proportions... right. I remember that when you enlarge something proportionally, the ratio between the width and height stays the same. So the original dimensions have a certain width to height ratio, and the new dimensions need to maintain that ratio. Let me check.\n\nFirst, the original width is 2 inches and the height is 1.5 inches. So the ratio of width to height is 2:1.5. Let me write that down. Maybe in fractions or decimals. Let me convert 1.5 inches to a fraction to make it easier. 1.5 is the same as 3/2, so the ratio is 2 divided by 3/2. Hmm, dividing by a fraction is multiplying by its reciprocal. So 2 times 2/3 is 4/3. So the ratio of width to height is 4:3. Let me confirm that. If I simplify 2 inches to 1.5 inches, which is 1.5 inches in height when width is 2 inches. So 2:1.5 can be written as 4:3 by multiplying numerator and denominator by 2. Yes, 2*2=4 and 1.5*2=3. So the ratio is 4:3. Therefore, the width is 4/3 of the height, or the height is 3/4 of the width. Since proportionality usually requires that the ratio remains the same, either way. So if the width is changed, the height will change accordingly. Let me check.\n\nWe know the original width is 2 inches, new width is 8 inches. So the scaling factor can be calculated by dividing the new width by the original width. So 8 inches / 2 inches = 4. Therefore, the logo is being enlarged by a factor of 4. So the height will also be multiplied by 4. Original height is 1.5 inches. So 1.5 inches * 4 = 6 inches. So the answer should be 6 inches tall. Let me verify this another way to be sure. Alternatively, using the ratio 4:3. If the new width is 8 inches, then set up a proportion: original width/original height = new width/new height. So 2/1.5 = 8/x. Cross-multiplying: 2x = 1.5*8. 1.5*8 is 12. So 2x = 12, so x = 6. Yep, same result. So that seems right. Therefore, the height will be 6 inches. I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe height of the enlarged logo will be \\boxed{6} inches.\n</think>\n\nAlexia designed a logo with an original width of 2 inches and height of 1.5 inches.

The school wants the logo on the notebook to be 8 inches wide. How tall, in inches, will it be if it is enlarged proportionately?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "<think>\nOkay, let me try to solve this problem step by step. So, Alexia made a logo that's 2 inches wide and 1.5 inches tall. The school wants the logo to be enlarged to 8 inches wide, and we need to find out how tall it will be, keeping the same proportions. Hmm, proportions... right, so it's a matter of scaling both the width and height by the same factor.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the scaling factor. The original width is 2 inches, and they want it to be 8 inches. To get from 2 to 8, what do I multiply by? Let me calculate that: 8 divided by 2 equals 4. So the scaling factor is 4. That means every inch in the original logo will be multiplied by 4 in the enlarged version.\n\nNow, applying this scaling factor to the original height. The original height is 1.5 inches. If we multiply 1.5 by 4, that should give the new height. Let me do the math: 1.5 times 4. Let's break it down. 1 times 4 is 4, and 0.5 times 4 is 2. So 4 plus 2 is 6. Therefore, the new height should be 6 inches.\n\nWait, let me check that again to be sure. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. So original height is 1.5, which is the same as 3/2 inches. Multiply by 4: 3/2 * 4 = 12/2 = 6. Yeah, that's correct. So the height becomes 6 inches. The proportions are maintained because both width and height are multiplied by 4.\n\nAlternatively, another way to check is using ratios. The original ratio of width to height is 2:1.5, which simplifies. Let's divide both by 0.5 to make it easier: 4:3. So the ratio is 4 to 3. Now apply this ratio to the new width. If the new width is 8 inches, then the new height should be (8 / 4) * 3. Wait, that might not be the right way. Let's see:\n\nOriginal ratio: width / height = 4 / 3. Since the scaling is proportional, the ratio of width/height remains the same. So the new width is 8 inches. Let me set up the proportion: 4 / 3 = 8 / x. Solving for x. Cross-multiplying, 4x = 24, so x = 6. Yes, that's the same answer. So the height is indeed 6 inches.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. Both methods give me the same result, so I feel confident that the answer is 6 inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe height of the enlarged logo will be \\boxed{6} inches.\n</think>\n\nAlexia designed a logo with a width of 2 inches and a height of 1.5 inches.

Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's write down the inequality again to make sure I have it right:\n\nFor all x in [0, 1], x\u00b2 cos\u03b8 - x(1 - x) + (1 - x)\u00b2 sin\u03b8 > 0.\n\nI need to find all \u03b8 in [0, 2\u03c0] where this is true for every x between 0 and 1. Well, since the inequality has to hold for all x in that interval, maybe I can consider the expression as a function of x and ensure that the minimum value of this function is positive for each \u03b8. So my plan is to find the minimum of this quadratic function over x \u2208 [0, 1] and ensure it's greater than zero.\n\nLet me first rearrange the expression to make it more familiar. Let's expand all the terms step by step.\n\nStarting with x\u00b2 cos\u03b8 - x(1 - x) + (1 - x)\u00b2 sin\u03b8.\n\nFirst, expand each term:\n\n1. The first term is x\u00b2 cos\u03b8.\n2. The second term is -x(1 - x) = -x + x\u00b2.\n3. The third term is (1 - x)\u00b2 sin\u03b8 = (1 - 2x + x\u00b2) sin\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 - 2x sin\u03b8 + x\u00b2 sin\u03b8.\n\nNow, combine all these terms together:\n\nx\u00b2 cos\u03b8 - x + x\u00b2 + sin\u03b8 - 2x sin\u03b8 + x\u00b2 sin\u03b8.\n\nLet's collect like terms:\n\n- x\u00b2 terms: cos\u03b8 x\u00b2 + sin\u03b8 x\u00b2 + x\u00b2. Let's factor x\u00b2: x\u00b2 (cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8 + 1).\n\n- x terms: -x - 2x sin\u03b8. Factor x: x(-1 - 2 sin\u03b8).\n\n- Constant term: sin\u03b8.\n\nSo the expression simplifies to:\n\nx\u00b2 (1 + cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8) + x (-1 - 2 sin\u03b8) + sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, let me check the coefficients again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\nx\u00b2 cos\u03b8 - x(1 - x) + (1 - x)\u00b2 sin\u03b8.\n\nExpanding step by step:\n\nx\u00b2 cos\u03b8 - x + x\u00b2 + sin\u03b8 - 2x sin\u03b8 + x\u00b2 sin\u03b8.\n\nCombine the x\u00b2 terms: cos\u03b8 x\u00b2 + x\u00b2 + sin\u03b8 x\u00b2 = x\u00b2 (cos\u03b8 + 1 + sin\u03b8).\n\nCombine the x terms: -x - 2x sin\u03b8 = -x(1 + 2 sin\u03b8).\n\nConstant term: sin\u03b8.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the expression simplifies to:\n\nx\u00b2 (1 + cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8) - x (1 + 2 sin\u03b8) + sin\u03b8.\n\nSo now, we have a quadratic in x: f(x) = Ax\u00b2 + Bx + C, where\n\nA = 1 + cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8,\n\nB = - (1 + 2 sin\u03b8),\n\nC = sin\u03b8.\n\nSince we need this quadratic to be positive for all x in [0, 1], the minimum of f(x) over this interval must be greater than zero. For a quadratic function, the minimum depends on where the vertex is. If the vertex is within the interval [0, 1], then the minimum is at the vertex; otherwise, it's at one of the endpoints. So we need to check two cases: when the vertex is inside [0, 1] and when it's outside.\n\nFirst, let's find the vertex of the quadratic. The x-coordinate of the vertex is at -B/(2A).

The goal is to find all angles \u03b8 between 0 and 2\u03c0 such that the inequality x\u00b2 cos\u03b8 - x(1 - x) + (1 - x)\u00b2 sin\u03b8 > 0 holds for all x in [0, 1]. Hmm, okay, so this inequality has to be true for every x in that interval. I need to figure out for which angles \u03b8 this is possible.\n\nFirst, maybe I can rearrange the expression or rewrite it in terms of x to make it easier to analyze. Let me try expanding the terms:\n\nThe original expression is x\u00b2 cos\u03b8 - x(1 - x) + (1 - x)\u00b2 sin\u03b8. Let's expand each part:\n\n1. x\u00b2 cos\u03b8 stays as is.\n2. -x(1 - x) becomes -x + x\u00b2.\n3. (1 - x)\u00b2 sin\u03b8 expands to (1 - 2x + x\u00b2) sin\u03b8.\n\nNow, let's combine all the terms:\n\nx\u00b2 cos\u03b8 - x + x\u00b2 + (1 - 2x + x\u00b2) sin\u03b8.\n\nLet me group the x\u00b2 terms, x terms, and constants:\n\nFor x\u00b2 terms: cos\u03b8 * x\u00b2 + sin\u03b8 * x\u00b2 = x\u00b2 (cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8)\n\nFor x terms: -x + (-2 sin\u03b8) * x = -x(1 + 2 sin\u03b8)\n\nFor constant term: sin\u03b8 * 1 = sin\u03b8\n\nSo the entire expression simplifies to:\n\nx\u00b2 (cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8) - x(1 + 2 sin\u03b8) + sin\u03b8 > 0 for all x in [0, 1].\n\nHmm, that seems a bit simpler. So now we have a quadratic in x: Ax\u00b2 + Bx + C, where:\n\nA = cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8\n\nB = - (1 + 2 sin\u03b8)\n\nC = sin\u03b8\n\nAnd this quadratic must be positive for all x in [0, 1]. Since we need this inequality to hold for all x in [0,1], we need to ensure that the quadratic is positive throughout that interval. For a quadratic to be positive everywhere on an interval, several conditions must be met. Since the coefficient of x\u00b2 is A = cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8, we need to check whether the parabola opens upwards or downwards, and whether the minimum (or maximum) of the quadratic on [0,1] is positive.\n\nFirst, let's consider the leading coefficient A = cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8. The sign of A affects whether the parabola opens upwards or downwards. If A > 0, the parabola opens upwards, so the minimum will be at the vertex. If A < 0, it opens downwards, so the maximum will be at the vertex, but we need the minimum to still be positive. If A = 0, then it's a linear function in x, which might also be problematic, but since the original quadratic has A = cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8, it's possible that A could be zero. However, if A = 0, then the quadratic reduces to a linear function: Bx + C. In that case, we would need Bx + C > 0 for all x in [0,1]. Since B and C would be constants, we would need to check the endpoints. But given that A is cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8, which can be zero if \u03b8 is such that cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8 = 0. So maybe \u03b8 needs to be such that cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8 \u2260 0. Hmm, but let's check.\n\nWait, the problem states that we need the expression to be positive for all x in [0,1]. So if A = 0, then it's linear. If the linear function is positive everywhere on [0,1], then that's okay. Otherwise, if A = 0 but the linear function dips below zero somewhere in [0,1], then that's not acceptable. So we need to handle two cases: when A > 0 and when A < 0.\n\nLet me split this into two cases:\n\nCase 1: A > 0 (cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8 > 0)\n\nCase 2: A < 0 (cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8 < 0)\n\nAnd then maybe check when A = 0 separately if necessary.\n\nFirst, let's handle Case 1: A > 0. Then the quadratic opens upwards, so the minimal value occurs at the vertex. The vertex of a quadratic ax\u00b2 + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). Here, a = cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8 > 0, so the vertex is at x = (1 + 2 sin\u03b8)/(2(cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8)).

Hmm, okay. So for each x from 0 to 1, substituting into the expression must result in a positive value. That means the entire expression must be positive for all x in that interval. Therefore, whatever function this is, it has to stay above zero for all x in [0,1].\n\nMaybe I can simplify the expression first. Let me try expanding the terms to see if I can combine like terms.\n\nStarting with x\u00b2 cos\u03b8:\n\nThat's straightforward, just x squared times cosine theta.\n\nThen the term -x(1 - x) can be expanded:\n\n- x + x\u00b2.\n\nThen the term (1 - x)\u00b2 sin\u03b8.

Let's collect the x\u00b2 terms, the x terms, and the constants.\n\nFor x\u00b2 terms:\n\ncos\u03b8 x\u00b2 + x\u00b2 + sin\u03b8 x\u00b2 = x\u00b2 (cos\u03b8 + 1 + sin\u03b8).\n\nFor x terms:\n\n- x - 2x sin\u03b8 = -x(1 + 2 sin\u03b8).\n\nFor constants:\n\nsin\u03b8.\n\nSo the entire expression simplifies to:\n\nx\u00b2 (cos\u03b8 + 1 + sin\u03b8) - x(1 + 2 sin\u03b8) + sin\u03b8 > 0 for all x \u2208 [0,1].\n\nHmm, that seems a bit simpler. Let me write that again:\n\nE(x) = (cos\u03b8 + 1 + sin\u03b8)x\u00b2 - (1 + 2 sin\u03b8)x + sin\u03b8.\n\nSo we need E(x) > 0 for all x \u2208 [0,1].\n\nThis is a quadratic in x.

Since it's a quadratic, its behavior depends on the coefficients and the interval we're considering.\n\nFor a quadratic to be positive on an interval, there are a few possibilities:\n\n1. The quadratic is always positive, i.e., it opens upwards (A > 0) and has no real roots (discriminant < 0).\n2. The quadratic is negative at some points in the interval, but we need it to stay positive.\n\nWait, but since we need E(x) > 0 for all x in [0,1], we have to ensure that the minimum of E(x) on [0,1] is positive. So perhaps the approach is to check the minimum of E(x) on [0,1] and ensure it's positive.\n\nTo find the minimum of a quadratic on an interval, we need to consider the vertex of the parabola and check if it lies within the interval. If the vertex is inside [0,1], then the minimum is at the vertex; otherwise, the minimum occurs at one of the endpoints.\n\nSo let's first compute the vertex of E(x).

So combining, that's -x(1 + 2 sin\u03b8).\n\nThe constant term is sin\u03b8 * 1.\n\nSo altogether, the expression is:\n\nx\u00b2 (cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8) - x(1 + 2 sin\u03b8) + sin\u03b8.\n\nTherefore, the original expression simplifies to:\n\nx\u00b2 (cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8) - x(1 + 2 sin\u03b8) + sin\u03b8.\n\nLet me denote this quadratic in x as Q(x):\n\nQ(x) = (cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8) x\u00b2 - (1 + 2 sin\u03b8) x + sin\u03b8.\n\nWe need Q(x) > 0 for all x in [0, 1]. So, essentially, the quadratic must stay positive over the interval [0,1]. To ensure that, I remember that for a quadratic function ax\u00b2 + bx + c to be positive on an interval, certain conditions must hold. Since the coefficients here are trigonometric functions of \u03b8, the analysis will involve inequalities with \u03b8.\n\nFirst, let me check the coefficient of x\u00b2: (cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8). Depending on its sign, the parabola opens upwards or downwards. If cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8 is positive, the parabola opens upwards; if negative, it opens downwards. Since we need Q(x) > 0 for x in [0,1], even if the parabola opens downward, we have to check if it's still positive in that interval. Let's note this.\n\nBut first, perhaps find the vertex of this quadratic to check where the minimum or maximum is. Then evaluate Q at that point. But since the interval is [0,1], we also need to ensure that the quadratic is positive at both endpoints x=0 and x=1.\n\nLet me check Q(0): plugging x=0 into Q(x):\n\nQ(0) = sin\u03b8. Since x=0 is in [0,1], Q(0) must be greater than 0. Therefore, sin\u03b8 > 0. So \u03b8 must be in (0, \u03c0), because sin\u03b8 is positive there. Wait, but \u03b8 is in [0, 2\u03c0), so sin\u03b8 > 0 implies \u03b8 \u2208 (0, \u03c0). So that's one condition: \u03b8 \u2208 (0, \u03c0).\n\nSimilarly, check Q(1): plug x=1 into Q(x):\n\nQ(1) = (cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8)(1) - (1 + 2 sin\u03b8)(1) + sin\u03b8.\n\nSimplify:\n\ncos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8 - 1 - 2 sin\u03b8 + sin\u03b8 = cos\u03b8 + sin\u03b8 - 1 - 2 sin\u03b8 + sin\u03b8 = cos\u03b8 - 1.\n\nTherefore, Q(1) = cos\u03b8 - 1. Since x=1 is also in [0,1], Q(1) must be greater than 0. So cos\u03b8 - 1 > 0 => cos\u03b8 > 1. But cos\u03b8 is always \u2264 1, so the only possibility is cos\u03b8 = 1. But wait, cos\u03b8 >1 is impossible. Therefore, this leads to a contradiction. That suggests that if Q(1) is required to be >0, but cos\u03b8 cannot be greater than 1. Therefore, our earlier conclusion that \u03b8 \u2208 (0, \u03c0) might be too restrictive? Wait, but we had Q(0) >0 requires \u03b8 \u2208 (0, \u03c0). However Q(1) >0 requires cos\u03b8 >1, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake here.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write out the expression again to make sure I have it right:\n\nx\u00b2 cos\u03b8 - x(1 - x) + (1 - x)\u00b2 sin\u03b8 > 0 for all x in [0, 1].\n\nMy goal is to find the values of \u03b8 in [0, 2\u03c0] that make this inequality true for every x in that interval. So, essentially, I need to ensure that no matter what x we pick between 0 and 1, the expression remains positive.\n\nLet me start by simplifying the expression. Maybe expanding the terms will help me see if there's a quadratic in x or something. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, let's expand each term step by step.\n\nStarting with the first term: x\u00b2 cos\u03b8 remains as is.\n\nSecond term: -x(1 - x) = -x + x\u00b2.\n\nThird term: (1 - x)\u00b2 sin\u03b8. Let's expand (1 - x)\u00b2 first: 1 - 2x + x\u00b2. So multiplying by sin\u03b8 gives sin\u03b8 - 2x sin\u03b8 + x\u00b2 sin\u03b8.\n\nNow, let's combine all the terms together:\n\nx\u00b2 cos\u03b8 + (-x + x\u00b2) + (sin\u03b8 - 2x sin\u03b8 + x\u00b2 sin\u03b8)\n\nLet me group like terms:\n\nFor x\u00b2 terms: x\u00b2 cos\u03b8 + x\u00b2 + x\u00b2 sin\u03b8 = x\u00b2 (cos\u03b8 + 1 + sin\u03b8)\n\nFor x terms: -x - 2x sin\u03b8 = x(-1 - 2 sin\u03b8)\n\nFor constant terms: sin\u03b8\n\nSo putting it all together, the entire expression becomes:\n\nx\u00b2 (cos\u03b8 + 1 + sin\u03b8) + x(-1 - 2 sin\u03b8) + sin\u03b8 > 0 for all x in [0,1].\n\nSo now, we have a quadratic in x. Let's write it as:\n\n[cos\u03b8 + 1 + sin\u03b8]x\u00b2 + [ -1 - 2 sin\u03b8 ]x + sin\u03b8 > 0 for all x \u2208 [0,1].\n\nThe quadratic is in terms of x, but the coefficient of x\u00b2, the linear term, and the constant term all depend on \u03b8. Our task is to find \u03b8 such that this quadratic is positive for all x between 0 and 1.\n\nSince this is a quadratic in x, maybe I can analyze it by considering its minimum in the interval [0,1]. If the quadratic is positive at x=0 and x=1, and its vertex (if it opens upwards) is also positive, then the entire quadratic is positive in the interval. Alternatively, if it opens downwards, then even if it's positive at the endpoints, the vertex might dip below zero. So, I need to check both endpoints and the vertex.\n\nBut first, let's note that since the parabola's leading coefficient is cos\u03b8 + 1 + sin\u03b8, which is a term involving \u03b8. Depending on \u03b8, this coefficient could be positive or negative. Therefore, the quadratic could open upwards or downwards. So, I need to consider both cases.\n\nLet me check the leading coefficient: cos\u03b8 + 1 + sin\u03b8. Let's denote this as A = cos\u03b8 + 1 + sin\u03b8. So A can be written as 1 + sin\u03b8 + cos\u03b8. Let me compute the minimum and maximum values of A.\n\nWe know that sin\u03b8 + cos\u03b8 can be written as \u221a2 sin(\u03b8 + \u03c0/4), so the range of sin\u03b8 + cos\u03b8 is [-\u221a2, \u221a2]. Therefore, A = 1 + sin\u03b8 + cos\u03b8 \u2208 [1 - \u221a2, 1 + \u221a2]. Since 1 - \u221a2 \u2248 1 - 1.414 \u2248 -0.414, which is negative, and 1 + \u221a2 \u2248 2.414, which is positive. Therefore, A can be both positive and negative. Hence, the quadratic can open upwards or downwards depending on \u03b8.\n\nTherefore, I need to split into cases:\n\nCase 1: A > 0 (i.e., cos\u03b8 + 1 + sin\u03b8 > 0). Then the quadratic opens upwards. In this case, to ensure the quadratic is positive on [0,1], we need the minimum of the quadratic on [0,1] to be positive.

So, since this is a quadratic, the question becomes: For what \u03b8 is Q(x) positive for all x in [0, 1]?\n\nTo analyze this, I should check the minimum value of Q(x) on the interval [0, 1]. If the minimum is positive, then the inequality holds everywhere on the interval. So, my strategy is to find the minimum of Q(x) over x \u2208 [0, 1] and ensure that this minimum is greater than 0.\n\nFirst, let's determine whether the quadratic opens upwards or downwards. The coefficient of x\u00b2 is (cos\u03b8 + 1 + sin\u03b8). Let's compute this coefficient:\n\ncos\u03b8 + 1 + sin\u03b8 = 1 + sin\u03b8 + cos\u03b8\n\nThe sign of this coefficient will determine whether the parabola opens upwards (if positive) or downwards (if negative).\n\nSo, first check when 1 + sin\u03b8 + cos\u03b8 > 0 and 1 + sin\u03b8 + cos\u03b8 < 0.\n\nSince sin\u03b8 and cos\u03b8 are each between -1 and 1, their sum can range from -2 to 2, so 1 + sin\u03b8 + cos\u03b8 ranges from 1 - 2 = -1 to 1 + 2 = 3. Therefore, the coefficient can be negative or positive.\n\nBut we need to analyze it. Let's check when 1 + sin\u03b8 + cos\u03b8 is positive or negative.\n\nBut perhaps instead of analyzing the positivity of the coefficient, let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, compute if the quadratic has its vertex within the interval [0, 1]. If the vertex is within [0, 1], then the minimum occurs at the vertex; else, the minimum occurs at one of the endpoints.\n\nGiven that Q(x) is a quadratic, its vertex is at x = -b/(2a), where a = (cos\u03b8 + 1 + sin\u03b8) and b = -(1 + 2 sin\u03b8). So,\n\nx_vertex = (1 + 2 sin\u03b8)/(2 (cos\u03b8 + 1 + sin\u03b8))\n\nWe need to check if x_vertex is in [0, 1].\n\nSo first, check if this x_vertex is between 0 and 1.\n\nTherefore, for \u03b8 where 0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 2\u03c0, x_vertex is in [0, 1] if:\n\n0 \u2264 (1 + 2 sin\u03b8)/(2 (cos\u03b8 + 1 + sin\u03b8)) \u2264 1\n\nBut this might be complicated.

Leading zeroes are allowed.  (Parity means 'odd' or 'even'; so, for example, $x_2$ and $x_3$ cannot both be odd or both be even.)<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many 6-digit sequences there are where no two adjacent digits have the same parity. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, let's recall that a digit can be either even or odd. The digits 0-9 are divided into even (0,2,4,6,8) and odd (1,3,5,7,9). So, there are 5 even digits and 5 odd digits. That might be important for calculating possibilities.\n\nThe problem states that no two adjacent digits can have the same parity. So, if I pick an even digit for x\u2081, then x\u2082 must be odd, x\u2083 even, and so on, alternating between even and odd. Similarly, if x\u2081 is odd, then x\u2082 must be even, and so on. So, the parity of each digit depends on its position in the sequence.\n\nWait, actually, let me check that. The condition is that no two adjacent digits have the same parity. So, if current digit is even, the next one must be odd; if current is odd, next must be even. So the parity alternates with each step. Therefore, the entire sequence must alternate between even and odd digits. \n\nBut hold on, starting with either even or odd, the parity alternates. So, the entire sequence's parity pattern is either even, odd, even, odd, even, odd or odd, even, odd, even, odd, even. Therefore, the first digit determines the entire subsequent parities. That makes sense. So, the total number of sequences would be the number of sequences starting with even (and following the alternating pattern) plus the number starting with odd (and following the alternating pattern).\n\nLet me verify. For example, a 2-digit sequence. If x\u2081 is even, then x\u2082 must be odd. There are 5 choices for x\u2081 (even) and 5 choices for x\u2082 (odd), so 5*5=25. If x\u2081 is odd, x\u2082 even: 5*5=25. Total 50. So for two digits, 50. Let me check if that's correct. Since total sequences without restriction would be 10*10=100, but with the restriction it's 50. That makes sense because each step has half the possibilities, so 10*5=50 for even start, 5*10=50 for odd start, total 100. Wait, but that's for two digits. For two digits, starting with even: x\u2081 has 5 choices, x\u2082 must be odd:5. Similarly starting with odd. So total 50. So that seems correct.\n\nSo, generalizing, for a sequence of length n, the number of such sequences is 5*5^{n-1} + 5*5^{n-1} = 2*5^n. Wait, no. Wait, no, for example, for n=2, that would be 2*5^2=50, which matches. For n=3, let's check. Starting with even: x\u2081=5, x\u2082 must be odd=5, x\u2083 must be even=5. So 5*5*5=125. Starting with odd: x\u2081=5, x\u2082 even=5, x\u2083 odd=5. So 5*5*5=125. Total 250. Which is 2*5^3=250. So yes, that seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, for n digits, the total number is 2*5^n. Wait, but wait, let's check n=1. For n=1, the number of sequences where no two adjacent digits have the same parity. But since it's only one digit, there are no two adjacent digits, so all 10 digits are allowed. So the answer should be 10. Let's check with the formula: 2*5^1=10. Correct. So that works. For n=2, 2*5^2=50, which is correct. For n=3, 2*5^3=250, which seems right. So, the general formula is 2*5^n.\n\nWait, but let's confirm with n=6. So, according to this, the answer is 2*5^6.

(Parity means 'odd' or 'even'; so, for example, $x_2$ and $x_3$ cannot both be odd or both be even.)<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many sequences of 6 digits we can form such that no two adjacent digits have the same parity (i.e., they can't both be odd or both be even). Leading zeroes are allowed. Hmm, parity is about odd and even numbers, so let's recall that even digits are 0,2,4,6,8 and odd digits are 1,3,5,7,9. Each digit has certain options depending on its parity. \n\nFirst, since each digit is from 0 to 9, each position can be any digit. But the restriction is only about the parity of consecutive digits. So, the problem is similar to a Markov chain or a sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me think how to model this.\n\nFor such sequences, the key idea is that each digit's parity determines the allowed parities for the next digit. Let's denote the number of sequences ending with an even digit as E_n and those ending with an odd digit as O_n, where n is the length of the sequence. Then, for each step, E_n and O_n can be calculated based on the previous counts.\n\nBase case: For a sequence of length 1, there are 10 possible digits. Since we need to split them into even and odd parities, E_1 = 5 (digits 0,2,4,6,8) and O_1 = 5 (digits 1,3,5,7,9). That makes sense because there's 5 even and 5 odd digits between 0 and 9.\n\nNow, for each subsequent position (from 2 to 6), we need to calculate how the previous counts affect the current ones. If the previous digit is even, then the next digit must be odd. Similarly, if the previous digit is odd, the next one must be even. So, the number of sequences ending with even at step n is equal to the number of sequences ending with odd at step n-1 multiplied by the number of even digits. Similarly for the odd sequences.\n\nWait, let me verify that. Suppose we have a sequence ending with an even digit. To make the next digit, we need to pick an odd digit. There are 5 odd digits, so each sequence ending with an even digit can be extended to 5 sequences. Similarly, a sequence ending with an odd digit can be extended to an even digit in 5 ways. Therefore, the recurrence relations should be:\n\nE_n = O_{n-1} * 5\n\nO_n = E_{n-1} * 5\n\nAnd the total number of sequences of length n is E_n + O_n.\n\nLet me check this for n=1: total sequences are 10, which is correct. For n=2, E_2 = O_1 *5 =5*5=25, O_2 = E_1 *5=5*5=25, total=50. Let's verify manually. For the second digit, we can't have the same parity as the first, so for each of the 10 first digits, there are 5 options for the second. 10*5=50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=3: E_3 = O_2 *5=25*5=125, O_3 = E_2 *5=25*5=125, total=250. Let's check: each sequence of length 2 has 50 possibilities, and for each of the second digits, we can again choose 5 different parities for the third digit. So, 50*5=250. Correct.\n\nContinuing this pattern, each step, the number of sequences doubles in size? Wait, no. Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, for n=1: total 10\n\nn=2: 50\n\nn=3: 250\n\nn=4: 1250\n\nn=5: 6250\n\nn=6: 31250\n\nWait a second, notice that starting from n=1: 10, 50 (10*5), 250 (50*5), 1250 (250*5), 6250 (1250*5), 31250 (6250*5). So each time it's multiplied by 5. So the total number for n=6 would be 10*5^{5} = 10*3125 = 31250.

So, the question is: How many sequences of 6 digits x\u2081, x\u2082, ..., x\u2086 can we form such that no two adjacent x_i have the same parity? Leading zeros are allowed. Parity means 'odd' or 'even', so consecutive numbers must alternate between odd and even digits. \n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We need to count all 6-digit sequences where each digit is either 0-9, but with the restriction that any two digits that are next to each other must be different in parity (i.e., one is odd and the other is even). Leading zeros are allowed, so the first digit can be 0, 1, 2, etc. \n\nOkay, so the digits can be split into two parity categories: odd and even. Let me note that there are 5 odd digits (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) and 5 even digits (0, 2, 4, 6, 8). Each position in the sequence must alternate between odd and even. \n\nSince the sequence has 6 digits, we need to check whether the sequence starts with an odd digit or an even digit. The key here is that the parity must alternate for every consecutive pair. So, if the first digit is odd, the second must be even, the third odd, and so on. Similarly, if the first digit is even, the second must be odd, third even, etc. \n\nTherefore, there are two cases to consider:\n\n1. Sequences starting with an odd digit (ODD-ODD-EVEN-ODD-EVEN-ODD)\n2. Sequences starting with an even digit (EVEN-ODD-EVEN-ODD-EVEN-ODD)\n\nFor each case, the number of possible sequences can be calculated separately, and then we add them together for the total number of valid sequences.\n\nLet me verify that. Let's take the first case: starting with an odd digit. The first digit has 5 choices (since there are 5 odd digits: 1,3,5,7,9). The second digit must be even, so 5 choices (0,2,4,6,8). The third digit must be odd again, 5 choices, and so on. So for each position, the number of choices alternates between 5 and 5 depending on the parity needed. Since there are 6 digits, starting with odd, the parities will alternate as O, E, O, E, O, E. So positions 1,3,5 are odd (5 choices each) and positions 2,4,6 are even (5 choices each). Therefore, the number of sequences in this case is 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 5^6.\n\nSimilarly, for the second case where the sequence starts with an even digit. The first digit has 5 choices (even digits: 0,2,4,6,8). Then the second digit must be odd, 5 choices, third digit even, 5 choices, etc. So again, alternating parities. The sequence will be E, O, E, O, E, O. So positions 1,3,5 are even (5 choices each) and positions 2,4,6 are odd (5 choices each). Therefore, the number of sequences here is also 5^6.\n\nTherefore, the total number of valid sequences is 5^6 + 5^6 = 2*5^6. Let me compute that. 5^6 is 15,625. So 2*15,625 = 31,250. Therefore, the answer should be 31,250.\n\nWait, let me check this again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst, confirming the parity options: odd digits are 1,3,5,7,9 (5 options), even digits are 0,2,4,6,8 (5 options). Correct. \n\nFor the first case starting with odd: positions 1,3,5 must be odd. Each has 5 options. Positions 2,4,6 must be even. Each has 5 options. So 5*5*5*5*5*5. Similarly, starting with even: positions 1,3,5 even (5 each), positions 2,4,6 odd (5 each). So same number, 5^6 for each case. So total 2*5^6. 5^6 is indeed 15,625, so 2*15,625=31,250.

So, the question is: How many sequences of 6 digits x\u2081, x\u2082, ..., x\u2086 can we form where no two adjacent digits have the same parity? Leading zeroes are allowed. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's recall that parity refers to whether a number is even or odd. So, two adjacent digits can't both be even or both be odd. The sequence has to alternate between even and odd digits. That means the parity of each digit depends on the previous one. Let me think if there's a pattern here.\n\nSince each digit after the first one must be of the opposite parity, the sequence of parities will alternate. For example, if x\u2081 is even, then x\u2082 must be odd, x\u2083 even, and so on, alternating. Similarly, if x\u2081 is odd, then x\u2082 must be even, x\u2083 odd, etc. So, there are two possibilities for the parity of the sequence: starting with even and alternating, or starting with odd and alternating. So, maybe we can calculate the number of valid sequences for each case separately and then add them together?\n\nLet me check that. Let's consider the two cases:\n\n1. The sequence starts with an even digit (parity E).\n2. The sequence starts with an odd digit (parity O).\n\nFor each case, the parity of the subsequent digits is determined. So, once we fix the parity of the first digit, the rest of the sequence must follow the alternating pattern. Now, we need to calculate the number of such sequences for each starting case and then add them up.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many choices we have for each position based on the parity.\n\nFor the first digit (x\u2081):\n- If the sequence starts with an even digit, there are 5 even digits (0,2,4,6,8).\n- If it starts with an odd digit, there are 5 odd digits (1,3,5,7,9).\n\nFor the subsequent digits (x\u2082 to x\u2086):\n- If the parity alternates, then each digit must be of the opposite parity of the previous one.\n- For the second digit (x\u2082), if x\u2081 was even, then x\u2082 must be odd, and there are 5 choices. Similarly, if x\u2081 was odd, x\u2082 must be even with 5 choices.\n- This pattern continues for each subsequent digit. Each time, the number of choices is 5, because, regardless of which parity is required, there are 5 digits of that parity.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me verify that. Let's take x\u2081. If it's even (5 choices), then x\u2082 must be odd (5 choices). Then x\u2083 must be even (5 choices), and so on. Similarly, if x\u2081 is odd (5 choices), then x\u2082 is even (5 choices), x\u2083 is odd (5 choices), etc. So, for each step after the first, we have 5 choices. Since there are 6 digits in total, the number of sequences for each starting case would be 5^5. Wait, why 5^5?\n\nWait, let's confirm. For example, starting with an even digit (E):\n\nx\u2081: 5 choices (even)\nx\u2082: must be odd: 5 choices\nx\u2083: must be even: 5 choices\nx\u2084: must be odd: 5 choices\nx\u2085: must be even: 5 choices\nx\u2086: must be odd: 5 choices\n\nSo, total sequences starting with E: 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 5^6. Wait, no. Wait, let's count step by step. The sequence is 6 digits. Starting with E:\n\n- x\u2081: 5 choices\n- x\u2082: 5 choices\n- x\u2083: 5 choices\n- x\u2084: 5 choices\n- x\u2085: 5 choices\n- x\u2086: 5 choices\n\nSo total sequences starting with E: 5^6. Similarly, starting with O:\n\nx\u2081: 5 choices (odd)\nx\u2082: 5 choices (even)\nx\u2083: 5 choices (odd)\nx\u2084: 5 choices (even)\nx\u2085: 5 choices (odd)\nx\u2086: 5 choices (even)\n\nTherefore, sequences starting with O: 5^6. So total sequences would be 5^6 + 5^6 = 2*5^6. Let me compute that.\n\n5^6 is 15625, so 2*15625=31250. So the total number is 31250.

Let me break this down step by step. First, let's recall that parity refers to whether a number is odd or even. So, each digit in the sequence can be odd or even, but each subsequent digit must be the opposite parity of the one before it. Also, leading zeroes are allowed, which means the first digit can be 0, right? That's important because otherwise, if leading zeros weren't allowed, we'd have to consider sequences starting with a non-zero digit. But since they are allowed, we can treat all digits from 0 to 9, each with their respective parities.\n\nLet me confirm the parity counts first. There are 5 even digits (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) and 5 odd digits (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) in the decimal system. So, half of the digits are even and half are odd. That symmetry might help in calculating the possible sequences.\n\nThe problem is asking for sequences of 6 digits with no two adjacent digits of the same parity. So, each digit after the first must alternate between even and odd. Let me structure this.\n\nLet's denote the parity of each digit in the sequence. If we start with an even digit, the next must be odd, then even, and so on. Similarly, if we start with an odd digit, the next must be even, then odd, etc. Therefore, the parity sequence is alternating. So, the parity of the digits in the 6-digit sequence must alternate starting with either even or odd.\n\nTherefore, the total number of such sequences would be the number of sequences starting with even parity multiplied by the number of choices for the first digit, plus the number of sequences starting with odd parity multiplied by the number of choices for the first digit.\n\nWait, actually, let's outline it step by step. Let's consider two cases: sequences where the first digit is even, and sequences where the first digit is odd.\n\nCase 1: First digit is even.\n\nIf the first digit is even, then the next digit must be odd, the third even, the fourth odd, the fifth even, and the sixth odd.\n\nSimilarly, Case 2: First digit is odd.\n\nThen, the sequence would be odd, even, odd, even, odd, even.\n\nSo, for each case, we can calculate the number of possible sequences.\n\nFor Case 1 (starting with even):\n\nThe first digit: 5 choices (0, 2, 4, 6, 8).\n\nSecond digit: must be odd. 5 choices (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).\n\nThird digit: even, 5 choices.\n\nFourth digit: odd, 5 choices.\n\nFifth digit: even, 5 choices.\n\nSixth digit: odd, 5 choices.\n\nSo, the number of sequences in Case 1 is 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 5^6.\n\nSimilarly, for Case 2 (starting with odd):\n\nFirst digit: 5 choices (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).\n\nSecond digit: even, 5 choices.\n\nThird digit: odd, 5 choices.\n\nFourth digit: even, 5 choices.\n\nFifth digit: odd, 5 choices.\n\nSixth digit: even, 5 choices.\n\nThus, the number of sequences in Case 2 is also 5^6.\n\nTherefore, total number of sequences is 5^6 + 5^6 = 2 * 5^6.\n\nWait, let me check if that's correct. But hold on, let's verify step by step. Let me compute 5^6 first.\n\n5^1 = 5\n\n5^2 = 25\n\n5^3 = 125\n\n5^4 = 625\n\n5^5 = 3125\n\n5^6 = 15625\n\nSo, 5^6 is 15,625. Therefore, 2 * 15,625 = 31,250.

The question is asking for the number of 6-digit sequences where each consecutive pair of digits has different parities. Leading zeros are allowed, so that's important because it means every position in the sequence can be a zero. The parity condition means that if one digit is odd, the next one has to be even, and vice versa. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's recall that each digit can be from 0 to 9. Since the sequence has 6 digits, each position can potentially have 0-9. However, the restriction is that no two adjacent digits share the same parity. So, each digit's parity must alternate.\n\nLet me think about the possible parities for each digit. Each digit can be either even or odd. Let's note that there are 5 even digits (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) and 5 odd digits (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) for each position. Wait, 0 is even, so yes, 0-9 inclusive has 5 even and 5 odd digits.\n\nBut here's the catch: if a digit is even, the next one has to be odd, and if a digit is odd, the next one has to be even. So the parity alternates with each step. Therefore, the entire sequence must alternate between even and odd digits (or odd and even) consistently throughout all 6 digits.\n\nSo, the key here is that the parity alternates each time. Let's consider two cases: sequences starting with an even digit and sequences starting with an odd digit. Then we can calculate the number of possibilities for each case and sum them up.\n\nLet's formalize this. Let's denote:\n\n- Let E(n) be the number of n-digit sequences starting with an even digit and satisfying the parity condition.\n- Let O(n) be the number of n-digit sequences starting with an odd digit and satisfying the parity condition.\n\nThen, the total number of sequences would be E(n) + O(n).\n\nNow, we need to find a recurrence relation for E(n) and O(n). Let's think about how to build up these sequences.\n\nFor a sequence of length n starting with an even digit (E(n)):\n\n- The first digit is even, which gives 5 possibilities (0, 2, 4, 6, 8).\n- The second digit must be odd, so from the 5 odd digits.\n- Then the third digit must be even again, so 5 choices again.\n- This alternates each time.\n\nSimilarly, for O(n):\n\n- First digit is odd, 5 choices.\n- Second digit must be even, 5 choices.\n- And so on.\n\nSo, if we look at the recurrence relations, for each n >= 2, we can express E(n) and O(n) in terms of E(n-1) and O(n-1). Let's verify:\n\nTo build an E(n) sequence (starting with even), we take an O(n-1) sequence (which ends with odd) and append an even digit. Similarly, to build an O(n) sequence, we take an E(n-1) sequence (ending with even) and append an odd digit.\n\nTherefore:\n\nE(n) = O(n-1) * 5\n\nO(n) = E(n-1) * 5\n\nSince each subsequent digit alternates parity.\n\nBut wait, let me check that. Let's test with n=1. For n=1, E(1) is 5 (the even digits) and O(1) is 5 (the odd digits), since the first digit can be even or odd. Then for n=2:\n\nE(2) = O(1) * 5 = 5 * 5 = 25\n\nO(2) = E(1) * 5 = 5 * 5 = 25\n\nSo, total sequences for n=2 is 25 + 25 = 50.\n\nCheck for n=3:\n\nE(3) = O(2) * 5 = 25 * 5 = 125\n\nSimilarly, O(3) = E(2) * 5 = 25 * 5 = 125\n\nTotal sequences: 250.

A 6-digit sequence means each digit is from 0 to 9, right? But the condition is that no two neighboring digits can be both even or both odd. So, if one digit is even, the next one has to be odd, and vice versa. This is similar to a parity alternating problem, but for digits.\n\nLet me think about parity. Even digits are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and odd digits are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. So, each even digit is divisible by 2, and each odd digit is not.

Similarly, if the nth digit is odd, the previous digit must be even.\n\nSo, E(n) = (number of ways to get an odd digit at position n-1) * (number of even digits)\nSimilarly, O(n) = (number of ways to get an even digit at position n-1) * (number of odd digits)\n\nBut the number of ways to get an odd digit at position n-1 is O(n-1), and the number of even digits is 5. Similarly, the number of ways to get an even digit at position n-1 is E(n-1), and the number of odd digits is 5.\n\nTherefore, the recurrence relations would be:\nE(n) = 5 * O(n-1)\nO(n) = 5 * E(n-1)\n\nTherefore, each term is 5 times the previous term's opposite parity.\n\nLet me check with n=2:\n\nE(2) = 5 * O(1) = 5 * 5 = 25\nO(2) = 5 * E(1) = 5 * 5 = 25\nTotal sequences for 2 digits: 25 + 25 = 50\n\nIs that right? Let's verify. For two digits, the first digit has 10 possibilities. The second digit has 5 possibilities if the first was odd, and 5 if the first was even. But since the first digit has 10 possibilities, but for each first digit, the second digit has 5 possibilities. Wait, but that would be 10*5 = 50. Yes, that matches. So for n=2, it's 50. That makes sense.\n\nSimilarly, E(3) = 5 * O(2) = 5 * 25 = 125\nO(3) = 5 * E(2) = 5 * 25 = 125\nTotal sequences: 125 + 125 = 250\n\nWait, but let's check if that's correct. For three digits, the first two digits form a valid sequence (50 possibilities). Then, each of those can be extended by 5 possibilities. So 50*5 = 250. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, following this pattern, each time we multiply by 10. Wait, n=1:10, n=2:50, n=3:250, n=4:1250, n=5:6250, n=6:31250?\n\nWait, let me check step by step:\n\nFor n=1: 10 sequences.\n\nn=2: 10*5 = 50\n\nn=3: 50*5 = 250\n\nn=4: 250*5 = 1250\n\nn=5: ", 0.5199999809265137], ["35", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

The question is asking for the greatest number of positive factors that \\( b^n \\) can have, where both \\( b \\) and \\( n \\) are positive integers less than or equal to 15. Hmm, so I need to find pairs \\( (b, n) \\) such that when you raise \\( b \\) to the power of \\( n \\), the result has the maximum number of divisors. \n\nFirst, I remember that the number of positive factors of a number is determined by its prime factorization. For a number \\( N \\), if \\( N = p_1^{a_1} \\times p_2^{a_2} \\times \\dots \\times p_k^{a_k} \\), then the number of positive divisors of \\( N \\) is \\( (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1)\\dots(a_k + 1) \\). So, my goal is to maximize this product given the constraints on \\( b \\) and \\( n \\).\n\nSince \\( b \\) and \\( n \\) are both positive integers up to 15, I need to consider different possibilities for their values and calculate the number of divisors each \\( b^n \\) would have. The challenge here is that \\( b^n \\) itself is a prime power if \\( b \\) is prime, but since \\( n \\) can be up to 15, the exponents in the prime factorization can be quite large. Alternatively, if \\( b \\) is a composite number, its prime factors could be raised to various exponents depending on \\( n \\).\n\nLet me start by breaking it down into cases where \\( b \\) is a prime or a composite number, and analyze the possible exponents for each case.\n\n**Case 1: \\( b \\) is a prime number.**\n\nIf \\( b \\) is prime, then \\( b^n \\) would have a single prime factor, which is \\( b \\) itself. The number of divisors would then be \\( n + 1 \\). So, for each prime \\( b \\leq 15 \\), we can calculate \\( n + 1 \\) where \\( n \\leq 15 \\). For example, if \\( b = 2 \\), the maximum number of divisors is \\( 15 + 1 = 16 \\). Similarly, for \\( b = 3 \\), it's also 16, and so on up to \\( b = 13 \\). Wait, \\( b = 13 \\) gives \\( 13^15 \\), which would have 16 divisors. But if \\( b = 11 \\), same thing. However, primes like \\( b = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 \\) will all have the maximum number of divisors (16) if \\( n = 15 \\).\n\nBut maybe there are composite numbers that, when raised to some exponent, result in more divisors. For example, consider \\( b = 6 \\), which is 2 * 3. Then \\( 6^n = 2^n * 3^n \\). The number of divisors would be \\( (n + 1)(n + 1) = (n + 1)^2 \\). For \\( n = 15 \\), that would be \\( 16^2 = 256 \\). That's way more than 16. Wow, so composite numbers can give more divisors.\n\nSo, this shows that composite numbers can have more factors. So, my initial case analysis for primes was too restrictive. I need to check composite numbers as well.\n\n**Case 2: \\( b \\) is a composite number.**\n\nFor composite numbers, \\( b^n \\) can have multiple prime factors, each raised to some exponent. The number of divisors is the product of one more than each exponent in the prime factorization. So, for example, if \\( b = 6 = 2 * 3 \\), then \\( 6^n = 2^n * 3^n \\), and the number of divisors is \\( (n + 1)(n + 1) \\). If \\( n = 15 \\), that's \\( 16 * 16 = 256 \\), as before.\n\nAlternatively, if \\( b = 12 = 2^2 * 3 \\), then \\( 12^n = 2^{2n} * 3^n \\), so the number of divisors is \\( (2n + 1)(n + 1) \\).

Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of positive factors of a number can be found using its prime factorization. If a number \\( N \\) has the prime factorization \\( p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\dots p_k^{a_k} \\), then the number of factors is \\( (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \\dots (a_k + 1) \\). So, to maximize the number of factors, I need to maximize this product, which depends on the exponents in the prime factorization of \\( b^n \\).\n\nBut \\( b^n \\) itself is a number, and its prime factors will be the same as those of \\( b \\), each raised to the power \\( n \\). So, let's denote the prime factorization of \\( b \\) as \\( p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\dots p_k^{e_k} \\). Then \\( b^n \\) would be \\( p_1^{e_1 n} p_2^{e_2 n} \\dots p_k^{e_k n} \\). Therefore, the number of factors of \\( b^n \\) would be \\( (e_1 n + 1)(e_2 n + 1) \\dots (e_k n + 1) \\).\n\nSo, my task is to choose both \\( b \\) and \\( n \\) (each up to 15) such that the product \\( (e_1 n + 1)(e_2 n + 1) \\dots (e_k n + 1) \\) is maximized.\n\nTo approach this, maybe I should look for numbers \\( b \\) that have more prime factors, each with higher exponents, and when raised to a power \\( n \\), these exponents contribute to a larger product when increased by 1. Since \\( n \\) is multiplied by the exponents, a higher \\( n \\) would increase the number of factors more if the exponents are larger.\n\nBut since both \\( b \\) and \\( n \\) are constrained to 15, I need to balance between a larger \\( n \\) and a number \\( b \\) with many small prime factors. Let me try to test some examples.\n\nFirst, consider prime numbers. If \\( b \\) is prime, say 2, then \\( 2^n \\) has factors \\( (n + 1) \\). The maximum for \\( n = 15 \\) would be 16 factors. But prime numbers are the simplest, but they only have one prime factor. Maybe having multiple prime factors can lead to more factors through the product.\n\nFor example, take \\( 6 = 2 \\times 3 \\). Then \\( 6^n = 2^n \\times 3^n \\), and the number of factors is \\( (n + 1)(n + 1) = (n + 1)^2 \\). For \\( n = 15 \\), that would be 16^2 = 256 factors. That's way more than 16 factors for a prime power.\n\nWait, so 256 is already a lot higher. Maybe even higher numbers with more prime factors?\n\nLet me check with 30 = 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5. Then \\( 30^n = 2^n \\times 3^n \\times 5^n \\), so the number of factors is \\( (n + 1)^3 \\). For n = 15, that would be 16^3 = 4096 factors. That's even more. Hmm, that seems really high. But wait, 30^15 is a huge number, but the number of factors is calculated as the product of (exponents + 1). So if 30 has three prime factors each raised to the 15th power, then the number of factors is (15 + 1)^3 = 16^3 = 4096. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me verify with smaller n. For example, if n = 2, then 30^2 = 900, which factors as 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^2, so number of factors is (2+1)(2+1)(2+1) = 3*3*3 = 27. For n=15, it's 16^3 = 4096.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of positive factors of a number is found by expressing the number in its prime factorization form and then adding one to each of the exponents and multiplying them. For example, if a number is \\( 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\), then the number of factors is \\( (3 + 1)(2 + 1) = 12 \\). So, the key here is to maximize the product of one more than each exponent in the prime factorization.\n\nNow, since \\( b^n \\) is the number we're dealing with, let's denote it as \\( k \\). So, \\( k = b^n \\). To maximize the number of factors of \\( k \\), we need to maximize \\( \\tau(k) \\), where \\( \\tau \\) is the divisor function.\n\nBut since \\( k \\) is a perfect power, its prime factorization will have exponents that are multiples of \\( n \\). For instance, if \\( b \\) is written as \\( p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\dots p_m^{a_m} \\), then \\( k = b^n = p_1^{n a_1} p_2^{n a_2} \\dots p_m^{n a_m} \\). Therefore, the exponents in the prime factorization of \\( k \\) are all multiples of \\( n \\), which means each exponent is at least \\( n \\), and potentially larger multiples of \\( n \\).\n\nOur goal is to choose \\( b \\) and \\( n \\) such that the product of \\( (e_i + 1) \\) for all exponents \\( e_i \\) in the prime factorization of \\( k = b^n \\), is maximized. To do this, we need to balance the exponents cleverly. Since increasing \\( n \\) will increase the number of exponents (if \\( b \\) has multiple prime factors), but also, the base \\( b \\) itself might not be too large, which would enable it to have multiple prime factors.\n\nLet me try to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, list all possible values of \\( b \\) from 2 to 15 and for each \\( b \\), compute \\( b^n \\) for \\( n \\) from 1 to 15, then calculate the number of factors for each combination. Then, find the maximum number of factors among all these combinations.\n\nBut doing this manually for every possible \\( b \\) and \\( n \\) would be tedious. There must be a smarter way.\n\nLet me think. The number of factors is determined by the exponents in the prime factorization. So, for each \\( b \\) and \\( n \\), we need to factorize \\( b \\), raise it to the power \\( n \\), and then calculate the product of (exponents + 1). So, the problem reduces to choosing \\( b \\) and \\( n \\) such that when \\( b \\) is raised to the power \\( n \\), the product of (exponents + 1) is maximized.\n\nTherefore, the strategy should be:\n\n1. Factorize possible bases \\( b \\) into their prime factors.\n2. For each \\( b \\), compute \\( b^n \\) and its prime exponents.\n3. Calculate the number of factors using the formula mentioned.\n4. Find the maximum over all possible \\( b \\) and \\( n \\).\n\nBut since we are limited to \\( b \\leq 15 \\) and \\( n \\leq 15 \\), let's consider possible values.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible prime factorizations for \\( b \\) from 2 to 15:\n\n2: prime\n3: prime\n4: 2^2\n5: prime\n6: 2\u00d73\n7: prime\n8: 2^3\n9: 3^2\n10: 2\u00d75\n11: prime\n12: 2^2\u00d73\n13: prime\n14: 2\u00d77\n15: 3\u00d75\n\nFor each of these, raising them to different powers \\( n \\) will affect the exponents.

So, \\( b \\) and \\( n \\) can be any integers from 1 to 15. Our goal is to find the combination of \\( b \\) and \\( n \\) that makes \\( b^n \\) have the maximum number of divisors.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of positive divisors of a number can be determined by its prime factorization.

So, to maximize the number of divisors, we need to maximize this product, which depends on the exponents in the prime factorization.\n\nSince \\( b^n \\) can be written as \\( (b)^n \\), the prime factorization of \\( b^n \\) is the same as each prime factor in \\( b \\) raised to the power \\( n \\times \\) its exponent in \\( b \\). Therefore, the exponents in the prime factorization of \\( b^n \\) will be \\( n \\) times each exponent from the prime factorization of \\( b \\).\n\nBut wait, actually, if \\( b \\) is factored into primes as \\( b = p_1^{k_1} \\times p_2^{k_2} \\times \\dots \\times p_m^{k_m} \\), then \\( b^n = p_1^{n k_1} \\times p_2^{n k_2} \\times \\dots \\times p_m^{n k_m} \\). Therefore, the exponents in the prime factorization of \\( b^n \\) are \\( n k_1 \\), \\( n k_2 \\), ..., \\( n k_m \\).\n\nTherefore, the number of divisors of \\( b^n \\) is the product of each exponent plus one: \\( (n k_1 + 1)(n k_2 + 1)\\dots(n k_m + 1) \\).\n\nSo, to maximize the number of divisors, we need to maximize this product.

Since we want the product \\( (n k_1 + 1)(n k_2 + 1)\\dots(n k_m + 1) \\) to be as large as possible, we need to maximize the sum of the exponents \\( n k_i \\), but since each term is added 1, it's a bit different. Also, the exponents themselves depend on both \\( b \\) and \\( n \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to consider the number of divisors as a function of \\( b \\) and \\( n \\), so to maximize \\( d(b^n) = (n k_1 + 1)(n k_2 + 1)\\dots(n k_m + 1) \\), where \\( b \\) has prime factors with exponents \\( k_i \\).\n\nGiven that \\( b \\) and \\( n \\) can be up to 15, we need to pick \\( b \\) and \\( n \\) such that when expanded, the product of (n*k + 1) for each prime factor k in b's factorization is maximized.\n\nSo perhaps the key is to choose \\( b \\) with a prime factorization that includes high exponents, and \\( n \\) as high as possible. However, if \\( n \\) is too high, maybe splitting the exponents across multiple primes can lead to a higher product.\n\nWait, but the product grows when we have more terms. So, even if we split a higher exponent into multiple smaller exponents, the product might increase. For example, if we have a term (15*2 +1) = 31, versus two terms (7*1 +1)=8 and (7*1 +1)=8, which together make 8*8=64. So 64 is larger than 31.

Specifically, if a number \\( N \\) has a prime factorization of \\( p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\dots p_k^{e_k} \\), then the number of positive factors of \\( N \\) is \\( (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\dots (e_k + 1) \\). So, to maximize the number of factors, we need to maximize this product by choosing appropriate exponents \\( e_1, e_2, \\dots, e_k \\) for the primes raised.\n\nHowever, in our case, the number is \\( b^n \\). So, first, \\( b \\) itself is a positive integer up to 15, and \\( n \\) is also up to 15. Our goal is to find \\( b \\) and \\( n \\) such that \\( b^n \\) has as many factors as possible.\n\nLet me think. Since \\( b^n \\) is a power of a single number, its prime factorization will be the prime factors of \\( b \\) each raised to the power \\( n \\times \\) their exponents in \\( b \\). Therefore, the number of factors of \\( b^n \\) will be the product of each exponent plus one. So, for example, if \\( b = p \\times q \\), where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are primes, then \\( b^n = p^n q^n \\), and the number of factors would be \\( (n + 1)(n + 1) \\). But if \\( b \\) is a prime power, say \\( p^k \\), then \\( b^n = p^{kn} \\), and the number of factors is \\( kn + 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, to maximize the number of factors, we need to choose \\( b \\) and \\( n \\) such that the product of exponents in its prime factorization is maximized when each exponent is multiplied by \\( n \\) and then incremented. So, maybe choosing \\( b \\) with multiple small prime factors would be better because when raised to a power \\( n \\), each of those exponents get multiplied by \\( n \\), hence increasing the total number of factors.\n\nBut since \\( n \\) is also a variable up to 15, we might need to balance between choosing a number \\( b \\) with many prime factors and a high exponent \\( n \\). However, since both \\( b \\) and \\( n \\) are capped at 15, maybe there's a sweet spot where their product in terms of factor contributions is maximized.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a highly composite number (HCN) within the range \\( b^n \\) would work. HCNs are numbers with more factors than any smaller positive integer. For example, 12 is a highly composite number because it has 6 factors, more than any smaller number. So, perhaps choosing \\( b \\) as a HCN and then maximizing \\( n \\) would give the maximum number of factors. But since \\( b \\) itself is constrained to 15, we need to check which HCN less than or equal to 15 is available, and then see what's the maximum \\( n \\) we can have for it.\n\nWait, the HCNs less than or equal to 15 are 1, 2, 4, 6, 12. Let me verify:\n\n- 1 has 1 factor.\n- 2 is prime, has 2 factors.\n- 4 is 2\u00b2, has 3 factors.\n- 6 is 2\u00d73, has 4 factors.\n- 12 is 2\u00b2\u00d73, has (2+1)(1+1)=6 factors.\n- Then 24 would be next HCN, but 24 is over 15.\n\nSo, HCNs up to 15 are 1, 2, 4, 6, 12.

Let me start by recalling that the number of positive factors of a number can be determined once we know its prime factorization. The formula for the number of factors is to take the exponents of the primes in the factorization, add one to each, and then multiply those together. For example, if a number is 2^3 * 3^2, then the number of factors is (3+1)*(2+1) = 12. So my goal is to maximize this product (k1+1)(k2+1)... where k1, k2, etc. are the exponents in the prime factorization of b^n.\n\nFirst, since both b and n are between 1 and 15, inclusive, I should consider values of b from 1 to 15 and n from 1 to 15. However, b=1 would only give 1^n=1, which has only 1 factor. Similarly, if n=1, then b^1 is just b, so the number of factors would be determined by the number of factors of b. Since we want the maximum number of factors, maybe n=1 isn't helpful because b is limited to 15, and the maximum number of factors for numbers up to 15 is for 12 (which has 6 factors), 14 (4 factors), 8 (4 factors), etc. Comparing that to when n>1, which would allow for more flexibility in exponents. So I should focus on n >=2.\n\nTherefore, the key is to find b^n where b is between 2 and 15, n is between 1 and 15, and the number of factors is maximized. Let me structure this step by step.\n\nFirst, list the numbers from 2 to 15 and their prime factorizations. Then, for each of these b, compute the number of factors for b^n for n from 2 to 15, and find the maximum among all these possibilities.\n\nBut doing this manually for 14 values of b and each n from 2 to 15 would take a lot of time. Maybe there's a smarter way. Alternatively, perhaps think about numbers that are highly composite, as those have the most factors. But even high composites like 12, 24, 36 have limits. Let me check which among the b^n would yield the highest number of factors.\n\nFirst, let's list all numbers from 2 to 15 and their factorizations:\n\n1. 2: prime\n2. 3: prime\n3. 4: 2^2\n4. 5: prime\n5. 6: 2*3\n6. 7: prime\n7. 8: 2^3\n8. 9: 3^2\n9. 10: 2*5\n10. 11: prime\n11. 12: 2^2*3\n12. 13: prime\n13. 14: 2*7\n14. 15: 3*5\n\nNow, for each of these, we need to compute b^n where n is up to 15, and find the maximum number of factors. Let's start with the prime numbers first. If b is prime (like 2,3,5,7,11,13), then b^n will have a prime factorization with exponent n. The number of factors is (n + 1). So for primes, the maximum number of factors would be when n is as large as possible. For example, if b=2, then 2^15 would have 15+1=16 factors. Similarly, if b is 13, which is prime, 13^15 would have 16 factors. So primes can give us a maximum of 16 factors. But perhaps composites can give more?\n\nLooking at composite numbers:\n\nStart with 4. 4 is 2^2. Then 4^n = 2^(2n). The number of factors is (2n +1). So maximum when n=15: 2*15 +1=31 factors. That's a lot. Wait, but 2^30 would have 31 factors. But 4^15 is 2^30. So 4^15 would have 31 factors. That's way more than the primes. Hmm, so maybe 4 is a better choice here.\n\nWait, let me verify.

What is the greatest number of positive factors $b^n$ can have?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the maximum number of positive factors that b^n can have, where both b and n are positive integers less than or equal to 15. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of positive factors of a number can be found by expressing the number as a product of prime factors in the form p1^a * p2^b * ... and then the number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)... So, for example, if a number is 12, which is 2^2 * 3^1, then the number of factors is (2+1)(1+1) = 3*2 = 6, and indeed, 12 has factors 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n\nSo, to maximize the number of factors of b^n, we need to maximize (a1+1)(a2+1)... where each ai is the exponent of a prime in the prime factorization of b^n. Since b^n is just the prime factorization of b raised to the power n, the exponents in its prime factorization will be n times the exponents in b's prime factorization.\n\nTherefore, the number of factors of b^n is (n*a1 + 1)(n*a2 + 1)... where a1, a2, etc., are the exponents in b's prime factorization.\n\nOur goal is to choose b and n (both \u226415) such that this product is as large as possible.\n\nSo, to maximize the product, we need to maximize each (n*ai + 1) term. However, since there are only two terms in the factorization unless b is prime. Let's check.\n\nIf b is a prime number, then b^n is p^n, so the number of factors is n+1. So, for example, 15^13 would have 14 factors, which is only 14, but if b is composite, then we can have more factors because the number of factors depends on the exponents in the prime factorization.\n\nSo, composite numbers should be considered because they can have multiple prime factors, leading to multiple exponents in their prime factorization, which in turn multiply together to give the total number of factors.\n\nTherefore, the strategy is to find composite b's with a prime factorization that gives exponents a1, a2, etc., such that when multiplied by n (and then incremented) gives the maximum product.\n\nBut since n is also up to 15, we need to pick n such that the total exponents after multiplying by n are as large as possible.\n\nLet me think. Let's list some composite numbers less than or equal to 15 and their prime factorizations.\n\nStarting with small b values:\n\n2: prime, factors=2\n\n3: prime, factors=2\n\n4: 2^2, factors=2+1=3\n\n5: prime, factors=2\n\n6: 2*3, factors=(1+1)(1+1)=4\n\n7: prime, factors=2\n\n8: 2^3, factors=3+1=4\n\n9: 3^2, factors=2+1=3\n\n10:2*5, factors=4\n\n11: prime, factors=2\n\n12:2^2*3, factors=(2+1)(1+1)=6\n\n13: prime, factors=2\n\n14:2*7, factors=4\n\n15:3*5, factors=4\n\nSo, among composites up to 15, the ones with exponents in their prime factors are:\n\n4=2\u00b2 (factors=3), 6=2*3 (factors=4), 8=2\u00b3 (factors=4), 9=3\u00b2 (factors=3), 12=2\u00b2*3 (factors=6), 14=2*7 (factors=4), 15=3*5 (factors=4). So, 12, 4, 8, 15, etc., have higher exponents.\n\nWait, 12 has exponents 2 and 1, so (2+1)(1+1)=6. So factors=6.\n\nIf we take other numbers, say 6=2*3, which is (1+1)(1+1)=4. So, 12 is better.\n\nSimilarly, 8=2\u00b3, factors=4. 15=3*5, factors=4.\n\nSo, the numbers with more prime factors or higher exponents in their prime factorization will lead to more factors when raised to a power n.

Hmm, cross product... I remember from my math class that the cross product of two vectors gives another vector that's perpendicular to both of them. The formula for the cross product in three dimensions involves the determinant of a matrix with the unit vectors i, j, k in the first row, the components of the first vector in the second row, and the components of the second vector in the third row. Let me try to recall that.\n\nSo, if I have vectors **a** = (a1, a2, a3) and **b** = (b1, b2, b3), then their cross product **a** \u00d7 **b** is calculated as:\n\n**a** \u00d7 **b** = |i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0|a1 a2 a3|\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0|b1 b2 b3|\n\nWhich expands to:\n\ni*(a2*b3 - a3*b2) - j*(a1*b3 - a3*b1) + k*(a1*b2 - a2*b1)\n\nOkay, so applying this formula to the given vectors. Let me substitute a1=2, a2=0, a3=3 and b1=5, b2=-1, b3=7.\n\nFirst, compute the i component: a2*b3 - a3*b2. Plugging in the numbers: 0*7 - 3*(-1) = 0 + 3 = 3. So the i component is 3i.\n\nNext, the j component: -(a1*b3 - a3*b1). So that's -(2*7 - 3*5) = -(14 - 15) = -(-1) = 1. Therefore, the j component is 1j.\n\nThen, the k component: a1*b2 - a2*b1. Plugging in: 2*(-1) - 0*5 = -2 - 0 = -2. So the k component is -2k.\n\nPutting it all together, the cross product is 3i + 1j - 2k, which in vector form is (3, 1, -2).\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the i component: 0*7 is 0, and 3*(-1) is -3. But since it's a2*b3 - a3*b2, it's 0*7 - 3*(-1) = 0 + 3 = 3. That's correct.\n\nFor the j component, it's - (a1*b3 - a3*b1). So first compute a1*b3: 2*7=14, then a3*b1=3*5=15. So 14 -15= -1. Multiply by -1 gives 1. That seems right.\n\nThen, the k component: a1*b2 - a2*b1. a1*b2=2*(-1)= -2, and a2*b1=0*5=0. So -2 -0= -2. Perfect, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the cross product is (3, 1, -2). Let me check if there's any other way to verify this. Maybe by cross-checking using another method?\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the cross product using the formula with determinants:\n\ni*(0*7 - 3*(-1)) - j*(2*7 - 3*5) + k*(2*(-1) - 0*5)\n\nCalculating each term step by step:\n\nFirst term for i: 0*7 is 0, 3*(-1) is -3. So 0 - (-3) = 3. Correct.\n\nSecond term for j: 2*7 is 14, 3*5 is 15. So 14 - 15 = -1. Multiply by -j: -(-1) = 1. Correct.\n\nThird term for k: 2*(-1) is -2, 0*5 is 0. So -2 - 0 = -2. Correct.\n\nSo same result. Therefore, the cross product is indeed (3, 1, -2). Let me also verify by cross-checking the direction. The cross product should be perpendicular to both original vectors.

Hmm, cross product... I remember it's a vector operation in three dimensions that results in a vector perpendicular to both of the original vectors. The formula for the cross product of vectors a = (a1, a2, a3) and b = (b1, b2, b3) is given by the determinant of a 3x3 matrix. Let me recall exactly how that matrix looks.\n\nSo, the cross product a \u00d7 b is equal to the determinant of the matrix:\n\n|i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k |\n|a1 a2 a3|\n|b1 b2 b3|\n\nWhere i, j, k are the unit vectors along the x, y, z axes. To compute this determinant, I need to expand it. The formula for the determinant of such a matrix is:\n\na2*b3 - a3*b2 in the i component,\na3*b1 - a1*b3 in the j component,\na1*b2 - a2*b1 in the k component.\n\nWait, let me verify that. When you expand the determinant for the cross product, it's:\n\ni*(a2*b3 - a3*b2) - j*(a1*b3 - a3*b1) + k*(a1*b2 - a2*b1)\n\nYes, that's correct. So, each component of the resulting vector is calculated by taking the determinant of the 2x2 submatrix and then applying the appropriate sign based on the position.\n\nAlright, now applying this formula to the given vectors. Let me write down the vectors again for clarity:\n\nVector a = (2, 0, 3)\n\nVector b = (5, -1, 7)\n\nSo, substituting into the formula:\n\nFirst component (i): (0*7 - 3*(-1)) = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nSecond component (j): -(2*7 - 3*5) = -(14 - 15) = -(-1) = 1\n\nWait, let me check that step again. The j component is negative of (a1*b3 - a3*b1). So:\n\na1 is 2, b3 is 7, a3 is 3, b1 is 5. So:\n\n2*7 (14) minus 3*5 (15). Then 14 - 15 is -1. But since it's the j component, it's the negative of that, so -(-1) = 1.\n\nThird component (k): (2*(-1) - 0*5) = (-2 - 0) = -2\n\nSo putting it all together, the cross product vector is (3, 1, -2).\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's verify using another method or formula.\n\nAlternatively, the cross product magnitude can be computed as |a||b|sin\u03b8, but since we only need the vector, that might not help. Alternatively, I can check by taking the dot product of the cross product with each original vector, which should be zero if they are perpendicular.\n\nLet me check a \u00b7 (a \u00d7 b) and b \u00b7 (a \u00d7 b).\n\nFirst, vector a is (2, 0, 3), cross product is (3, 1, -2).\n\nDot product a \u00b7 (3, 1, -2) = 2*3 + 0*1 + 3*(-2) = 6 + 0 -6 = 0. Good.\n\nSimilarly, vector b is (5, -1, 7). Dot product with cross product:\n\n5*3 + (-1)*1 + 7*(-2) = 15 -1 -14 = 0. Perfect, so the cross product is indeed perpendicular to both original vectors.\n\nTherefore, the cross product is (3, 1, -2). I think that's correct. Let me just recheck the components step by step again:\n\n1. i component: (a2*b3 - a3*b2) = (0*7 - 3*(-1)) = 0 + 3 = 3 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. j component: -(a1*b3 - a3*b1) = -(2*7 - 3*5) = -(14 -15) = -(-1) = 1 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. k component: (a1*b2 - a2*b1) = (2*(-1) - 0*5) = -2 -0 = -2 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYep, all components check out.

Hmm, cross product... let me remember how that works. I think it involves using the determinant of a matrix with the unit vectors i, j, k in the first row, the components of the first vector in the second row, and the components of the second vector in the third row. Then, expanding that determinant to get the components of the resulting vector. Let me verify if I'm doing it right.\n\nFirst, let me recall the formula. If we have two vectors a = (a1, a2, a3) and b = (b1, b2, b3), then their cross product a \u00d7 b is given by the determinant:\n\n|i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k |\n|a1 a2 a3|\n|b1 b2 b3|\n\nWhich expands to i*(a2b3 - a3b2) - j*(a1b3 - a3b1) + k*(a1b2 - a2b1). Yeah, that sounds right. So now, plugging in the values for the given vectors.\n\nSo vector a is (2, 0, 3) and vector b is (5, -1, 7). Let me write them down:\n\na1 = 2, a2 = 0, a3 = 3\n\nb1 = 5, b2 = -1, b3 = 7\n\nNow, compute each component step by step.\n\nFirst component (i): (a2b3 - a3b2) = (0*7 - 3*(-1)) = 0 + 3 = 3. So the i component is 3.\n\nSecond component (j): - (a1b3 - a3b1) = - [ (2*7 - 3*5) ] = - [14 - 15] = - [ -1 ] = 1. Wait, let me check that again. The formula is - (a1b3 - a3b1). So first compute a1b3: 2*7=14. Then a3b1: 3*5=15. Then subtract: 14-15=-1. Then take the negative of that: -(-1)=1. So yes, the j component is 1.\n\nThird component (k): (a1b2 - a2b1) = (2*(-1) - 0*5) = -2 -0 = -2. So the k component is -2.\n\nTherefore, the cross product should be (3, 1, -2). Let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst component: 0*7 -3*(-1) = 0 +3 =3. Correct.\n\nSecond component: - (2*7 -3*5) = - (14 -15) = - (-1) =1. Correct.\n\nThird component: 2*(-1) -0*5 = -2 -0 = -2. Correct.\n\nHmm, that seems right. Let me check if I mixed up any signs or components. Let's go through the determinant method again.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\ni*(0*7 -3*(-1)) -j*(2*7 -3*5) +k*(2*(-1) -0*5)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\ni*(0 +3) -j*(14 -15) +k*(-2 -0)\n\nSo 3i - (-1)j + (-2)k = 3i +1j -2k, which is (3,1,-2). Yep, same result. So I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check by using another method, like the component-wise formula. The cross product formula is:\n\nIf a = (a1, a2, a3) and b = (b1, b2, b3), then a \u00d7 b = (a2b3 - a3b2, a3b1 - a1b3, a1b2 - a2b1). Wait, that's actually similar to the standard formula but reordered. Let me check:\n\nWait, in the standard formula, it's (a2b3 - a3b2, a3b1 - a1b3, a1b2 - a2b1). So each component is as follows:\n\nFirst component: a2b3 - a3b2\n\nSecond component: a3b1 - a1b3\n\nThird component: a1b2 - a2b1\n\nSo let's compute each one.\n\nFirst component: a2b3 - a3b2 = 0*7 -3*(-1)", 0.550000011920929], ["35", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

I need to find the cross product of these two vectors: (2, 0, 3) and (5, -1, 7). Hmm, I remember cross products involve some kind of determinant formula with the unit vectors i, j, k. Let me try to recall how that works step by step.\n\nFirst, I think the cross product formula for two vectors **a** = (a\u2081, a\u2082, a\u2083) and **b** = (b\u2081, b\u2082, b\u2083) is given by the determinant of a 3x3 matrix. The first row is the unit vectors i, j, k. The second row is the components of **a**, and the third row is the components of **b**. Then you calculate the determinant. Let me write that out mentally.\n\nSo, the matrix would look like:\n\n| i   j    k  |\n| a\u2081 a\u2082 a\u2083|\n| b\u2081 b\u2082 b\u2083|\n\nWhich translates to the cross product **a** \u00d7 **b** = (a\u2082b\u2083 - a\u2083b\u2082)i - (a\u2081b\u2083 - a\u2083b\u2081)j + (a\u2081b\u2082 - a\u2082b\u2081)k. Wait, let me check the signs here. I think the j component carries a negative sign. Let me confirm: the i component is (a\u2082b\u2083 - a\u2083b\u2082), the j component is -(a\u2081b\u2083 - a\u2083b\u2081), and the k component is (a\u2081b\u2082 - a\u2082b\u2081). Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlright, so applying this formula to the given vectors. Let's plug in the values:\n\n**a** = (2, 0, 3) and **b** = (5, -1, 7).\n\nSo, a\u2081 = 2, a\u2082 = 0, a\u2083 = 3.\n\nb\u2081 = 5, b\u2082 = -1, b\u2083 = 7.\n\nCalculating each component step by step.\n\nFirst component (i component): a\u2082b\u2083 - a\u2083b\u2082.\n\nThat's (0)(7) - (3)(-1) = 0 - (-3) = 0 + 3 = 3.\n\nSecond component (j component): -(a\u2081b\u2083 - a\u2083b\u2081).\n\nThat's -[(2)(7) - (3)(5)] = -[14 - 15] = -[ -1 ] = 1.\n\nThird component (k component): a\u2081b\u2082 - a\u2082b\u2081.\n\nThat's (2)(-1) - (0)(5) = -2 - 0 = -2.\n\nSo putting all together, the cross product should be (3, 1, -2).\n\nWait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor the i component: yes, 0*7 is 0, and 3*(-1) is -3. So 0 - (-3) is 3. Correct.\n\nFor the j component: the formula has a negative sign. Let's check the calculation inside the brackets: 2*7 is 14, 3*5 is 15. So 14 - 15 is -1. Then multiplied by -1 gives 1. Correct.\n\nFor the k component: 2*(-1) is -2, 0*5 is 0. So -2 - 0 is -2. Correct.\n\nSo all components are 3, 1, and -2. Therefore, the cross product is (3, 1, -2).

So, I need to find the cross product of two vectors: the first one is (2, 0, 3) and the second is (5, -1, 7). Hmm, cross product... right, that's a vector operation that results in another vector perpendicular to both original vectors. I remember the formula involves determinants, but let me make sure I recall it correctly.\n\nThe cross product of two vectors a = (a\u2081, a\u2082, a\u2083) and b = (b\u2081, b\u2082, b\u2083) is given by the determinant of a 3x3 matrix. The formula is:\n\na \u00d7 b = |i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |a\u2081 a\u2082 a\u2083|\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |b\u2081 b\u2082 b\u2083|\n\nWhere i, j, k are the unit vectors in the x, y, z directions. Expanding this determinant gives:\n\ni*(a\u2082b\u2083 - a\u2083b\u2082) - j*(a\u2081b\u2083 - a\u2083b\u2081) + k*(a\u2081b\u2082 - a\u2082b\u2081)\n\nSo, each component is calculated by taking the determinant of the minor matrix. Let me apply this step by step to the given vectors.\n\nFirst, let's write down the vectors clearly:\n\nVector a: (2, 0, 3)\n\nVector b: (5, -1, 7)\n\nSo, a\u2081 = 2, a\u2082 = 0, a\u2083 = 3; and b\u2081 = 5, b\u2082 = -1, b\u2083 = 7.\n\nNow, let's compute each component of the cross product.\n\nStarting with the i component (the first component), which is calculated as a\u2082b\u2083 - a\u2083b\u2082.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\na\u2082b\u2083 = 0*7 = 0\n\na\u2083b\u2082 = 3*(-1) = -3\n\nSo, the i component is 0 - (-3) = 3. Wait, hold on, that's 0 - (-3) which is 3. Wait, let me check again. Wait, i component is a\u2082b\u2083 - a\u2083b\u2082. So 0*7 = 0, and 3*(-1) = -3, so 0 - (-3) = 3. Correct.\n\nNext, the j component. But remember, there's a negative sign before the j component in the formula. So, it's - (a\u2081b\u2083 - a\u2083b\u2081 )\n\nLet's compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, compute a\u2081b\u2083 - a\u2083b\u2081:\n\na\u2081b\u2083 = 2*7 = 14\n\na\u2083b\u2081 = 3*5 = 15\n\nSo, 14 - 15 = -1\n\nThen, since it's negative of that, the j component is -(-1) = 1. So the j component is 1.\n\nNow, the k component is a\u2081b\u2082 - a\u2082b\u2081:\n\na\u2081b\u2082 = 2*(-1) = -2\n\na\u2082b\u2081 = 0*5 = 0\n\nSo, -2 - 0 = -2. Therefore, the k component is -2.\n\nPutting all together, the cross product is:\n\ni component: 3\n\nj component: 1\n\nk component: -2\n\nSo, the resulting vector is (3, 1, -2). Let me verify this once again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic mistakes.\n\nFirst, check the i component again:\n\na\u2082b\u2083 - a\u2083b\u2082 = 0*7 - 3*(-1) = 0 - (-3) = 3. Correct.\n\nj component: -(a\u2081b\u2083 - a\u2083b\u2081) = -(14 - 15) = -(-1) = 1. Correct.\n\nk component: a\u2081b\u2082 - a\u2082b\u2081 = 2*(-1) - 0*5 = -2 - 0 = -2. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the cross product is (3, 1, -2). Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything and that the signs are properly handled.\n\n1.

The vectors are given as (2, 0, 3) and (5, -1, 7). Hmm, cross product... I remember it's like a multiplication of vectors but in three dimensions, and the result is another vector that's perpendicular to both of the original ones. Let me think step by step how to do this.\n\nFirst, let me recall the formula for the cross product. If I have two vectors, say vector A = (a1, a2, a3) and vector B = (b1, b2, b3), their cross product A \u00d7 B is calculated using the determinant of a 3x3 matrix. The determinant is expanded using the unit vectors i, j, k as the first row, the components of A as the second row, and the components of B as the third row. Let me write that out.\n\nSo, the formula would be:\n\nA \u00d7 B = |i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |a1 a2 a3|\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |b1 b2 b3|\n\nExpanded, this determinant is:\n\ni*(a2*b3 - a3*b2) - j*(a1*b3 - a3*b1) + k*(a1*b2 - a2*b1)\n\nLet me check if I have that right. Yes, the cross product components are column-wise, alternating signs starting with positive for the first component. So, i component is (a2b3 - a3b2), j component is -(a1b3 - a3b1), and k component is (a1b2 - a2b1). \n\nAlright, now let's plug in the values from the given vectors. Vector A is (2, 0, 3) and vector B is (5, -1, 7). So substituting:\n\na1 = 2, a2 = 0, a3 = 3\n\nb1 = 5, b2 = -1, b3 = 7\n\nNow compute each component step by step.\n\nFirst, the i component: a2*b3 - a3*b2\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n0*7 - 3*(-1) = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nSo the i component is 3.\n\nNext, the j component: -(a1*b3 - a3*b1)\n\nCompute a1*b3 - a3*b1 first:\n\n2*7 - 3*5 = 14 - 15 = -1\n\nThen apply the negative sign: -(-1) = 1\n\nSo the j component is 1. Wait, hold on, maybe I need to double-check that. Let me verify.\n\nWait, the magnitude of the j component is subtracted. The formula is -j*(a1b3 - a3b1). So the calculation inside is a1b3 - a3b1 = 2*7 - 3*5 = 14 - 15 = -1. Then multiplied by -1 (from the -j) gives 1. So yes, the j component is 1.\n\nNow the k component: a1*b2 - a2*b1\n\nCalculating:\n\n2*(-1) - 0*5 = -2 - 0 = -2\n\nSo the k component is -2.\n\nPutting it all together, the cross product is:\n\n(3, 1, -2)\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me verify each step again.\n\nFor the i component:\n\na2*b3 - a3*b2 = 0*7 - 3*(-1) = 0 + 3 = 3. Correct.\n\nFor the j component:\n\n-(a1*b3 - a3*b1) = -(14 - 15) = -(-1) = 1. Correct.\n\nFor the k component:\n\na1*b2 - a2*b1 = 2*(-1) - 0*5 = -2 - 0 = -2. Correct.\n\nSo the cross product is (3, 1, -2). Let me check if this makes sense. The result should be a vector perpendicular to both original vectors. To verify, I can check if the dot product with each original vector is zero.\n\nFirst, check dot product with vector A (2, 0, 3):\n\n3*2 + 1*0 + (-2)*3 = 6 + 0 -6 = 0. Perfect.\n\nThen check with vector B (5, -1, 7):\n\n3*5 + 1*(-1) + (-2)*7 = 15 -1 -14 = 0. Also zero. So it checks out.\n\nTherefore, the cross product is (3, 1, -2).

The vectors given are (2, 0, 3) and (5, -1, 7). Let me remember how cross products work. \n\nFrom what I recall, the cross product of two vectors, say **a** = (a\u2081, a\u2082, a\u2083) and **b** = (b\u2081, b\u2082, b\u2083), is calculated using the determinant of a matrix. The formula involves the unit vectors i, j, k in the first row, the components of **a** in the second row, and the components of **b** in the third row. Let me jot that down to visualize it better.\n\nThe cross product **a** \u00d7 **b** is:\n\n|\ni   j   k\na\u2081 a\u2082 a\u2083\nb\u2081 b\u2082 b\u2083\n|\n\nTo compute this determinant, I remember expanding it along the top row. So, the determinant is calculated as i*(a\u2082b\u2083 - a\u2083b\u2082) - j*(a\u2081b\u2083 - a\u2083b\u2081) + k*(a\u2081b\u2082 - a\u2082b\u2081). Let me verify if I have that right. Yes, each term is the product of the elements opposite the ones not in the same row or column multiplied by the appropriate sign.\n\nLet me write this step by step. For the i component, it's (a\u2082b\u2083 - a\u2083b\u2082), since those are the elements not in the first row's first column. Then for the j component, it's negative of (a\u2081b\u2083 - a\u2083b\u2081), because j is in the second position, so the sign is negative. Finally, for the k component, it's (a\u2081b\u2082 - a\u2082b\u2081). \n\nAlright, now let's plug in the actual values from the vectors given. The first vector is (2, 0, 3) so a\u2081=2, a\u2082=0, a\u2083=3. The second vector is (5, -1, 7) so b\u2081=5, b\u2082=-1, b\u2083=7.\n\nStarting with the i component: (a\u2082b\u2083 - a\u2083b\u2082) = (0*7 - 3*(-1)). Let me compute that. 0*7 is 0, and 3*(-1) is -3, but since it's subtracting a\u2083b\u2082, which is 3 times -1, subtracting a negative becomes adding. So 0 - (-3) = 0 + 3 = 3. So the i component is 3i.\n\nNext, the j component. Remember it's negative of (a\u2081b\u2083 - a\u2083b\u2081) = -(2*7 - 3*5). Let me compute inside the parentheses first. 2*7 is 14, and 3*5 is 15. So 14 - 15 is -1. Then multiply by -1 because of the negative sign in front: -(-1) = 1. So the j component is 1j, which is just 1j.\n\nFinally, the k component: (a\u2081b\u2082 - a\u2082b\u2081) = (2*(-1) - 0*5). Compute that. 2*(-1) is -2, and 0*5 is 0. So -2 - 0 = -2. Hence, the k component is -2k.\n\nPutting it all together, the cross product is 3i + 1j - 2k. In vector notation, that would be (3, 1, -2). Let me check if I did everything right step by step.\n\nWait, let me verify each component again to be sure.\n\nFor the i component: a\u2082 is 0, b\u2083 is 7. So 0*7 is 0. a\u2083 is 3, b\u2082 is -1. So 3*(-1) is -3. Then 0 - (-3) is 0 +3=3. Correct.\n\nFor the j component: a\u2081 is 2, b\u2083 is7. 2*7=14. a\u2083 is 3, b\u2081 is5. 3*5=15. So 14-15=-1. Then the negative of that is -(-1)=1. So j component is 1. Correct.\n\nFor the k component: a\u2081 is2, b\u2082 is -1. 2*(-1)=-2. a\u2082 is0, b\u2081 is5. 0*5=0. So -2 -0=-2. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the cross product is (3,1,-2). Let me just cross-", 0.5], ["35", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

What is the least three-digit 9-heavy whole number?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, the question is asking for the least three-digit 9-heavy whole number. A number is 9-heavy if when you divide it by 9, the remainder is greater than 5. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand what exactly a \"9-heavy\" number is. The problem states that the remainder when the number is divided by 9 has to be greater than 5. So, if we divide a number by 9 and look at the leftover after division, that leftover has to be more than 5. The possible remainders when dividing by 9 are 0 through 8, right? So, the remainder can be 7 or 8 if the number is to be 9-heavy. Wait, no. Let me check that again.\n\nIf the remainder is greater than 5, then the possible remainders are 6, 7, or 8. Yep, that's correct. So, numbers that leave a remainder of 6, 7, or 8 when divided by 9 are considered 9-heavy. Got it.\n\nNow, the task is to find the smallest three-digit number that is 9-heavy. So, the smallest three-digit number is 100. Let me check if 100 is 9-heavy. To do that, I need to compute 100 divided by 9 and find the remainder.\n\nDividing 100 by 9: 9 times 11 is 99, right? So, 11 times 9 is 99, and 100 minus 99 is 1. So, the remainder is 1. Since 1 is not greater than 5, 100 is not 9-heavy. So, we need to check the next numbers until we find one that has a remainder of 6, 7, or 8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way than checking each number one by one. Let's think about it. The three-digit numbers range from 100 to 999. The 9-heavy numbers are those congruent to 6, 7, or 8 modulo 9. So, any number in the three-digit range where N \u2261 6, 7, or 8 mod 9.\n\nTherefore, to find the smallest such number, we can start from 100 and check each number incrementing by 1 until we hit a number that is congruent to 6, 7, or 8 modulo 9.\n\nAlternatively, compute 100 mod 9 and then see how much we need to add to reach the next numbers in the desired remainder set.\n\nFirst, let me compute 100 divided by 9:\n\n100 \u00f7 9 = 11 with a remainder of 1, as before. So, 100 \u2261 1 mod 9.\n\nWe need a remainder of 6, 7, or 8. So, starting from 1, we can find how many more we need to add to reach the next possible remainder in the set.\n\nThe difference between 1 and 6 is 5. But if the next remainder is 6, then 1 + 5 = 6. But maybe 6 is not in the required set? Wait, the required set is 6,7,8. So, starting from 1, adding 5 gives 6, which is acceptable. So, 100 + 5 = 105. Let me check 105 \u00f7 9.\n\n105 \u00f7 9 = 11 \u00d7 9 = 99, remainder 6. So, 105 is 9-heavy. But wait, 100 + 5 is 105. But let me verify that. If 100 is 2 mod 9 (since 9\u00d711=99, 100-99=1; 9\u00d712=108, so 100 is 100-99=1, so 1 mod 9). Therefore, the next numbers congruent to 6 mod 9 would be 100 + (6 -1) = 105. Similarly, if we check 105: 105 \u00f7 9 = 11\u00d79=99, remainder 6. So, 105 is indeed 9-heavy.\n\nWait, but let me check 105 step by step. Let's divide 105 by 9:\n\n9 \u00d7 11 = 99. 105 - 99 = 6.

The problem says a number is \"9-heavy\" if when you divide it by 9, the remainder is greater than 5. Hmm, so the remainder after division by 9 needs to be more than 5. Let me break that down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall how division with remainders works. When you divide a number by 9, the remainder can range from 0 to 8. So \"9-heavy\" would mean the remainder is 6, 7, or 8. Because 6, 7, 8 are all greater than 5, right? Let me check: 6 > 5, yes; 7 >5, yes; 8 >5, yes. So the remainder when divided by 9 must be in {6,7,8}.\n\nTherefore, any three-digit number that leaves a remainder of 6, 7, or 8 when divided by 9 is considered 9-heavy. My task is to find the smallest such three-digit number. So, the smallest three-digit number is 100. Let me check what the remainder is when 100 is divided by 9.\n\nCalculating 100 \u00f7 9. 9*11=99, so 100-99=1. So the remainder is 1. That's way less than 6, so 100 is not 9-heavy. Then I need to check numbers sequentially until I find the first one that gives a remainder of 6,7, or 8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way than checking each number one by one. Let me think. Let's denote the three-digit number as N. Then, N is 9-heavy if N \u2261 r mod 9 where r \u2208 {6,7,8}. So N can be written as 9k + r, where k is an integer, and r is 6,7,8. To find the smallest three-digit N, I need the smallest k such that 9k + r \u2265 100 for some r in {6,7,8}.\n\nSo let's model this. Let me compute 100 divided by 9 first. 9*11=99, 100-99=1. So 100 = 9*11 +1. Therefore, the remainder is 1. So to get a remainder of at least 6, we need the smallest k such that 9k +6, 9k +7, or 9k +8 is >=100, and k is an integer.\n\nSo starting from k=11: 9*11=99. Then 99 +6=105, which is 105. Let me check 105. 105 divided by 9: 9*11=99, 105-99=6. So remainder 6. Therefore, 105 is 9-heavy. Wait, is that the first one? Let me check numbers between 100 and 105 to see if there is any number that might have a higher remainder.\n\nWait, let me check 100 first: remainder 1. 101: 101-9*11=101-99=2. 102: 3, 103:4, 104:5. So up to 104, the remainder is 5. Then 105:6. So actually, 105 is the first three-digit number that is 9-heavy. But let me confirm this step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check 9*11 +6=105. So 9*11 is 99, 99+6=105. So 105 is indeed the next number after 99 with a remainder of 6. So 105 is the smallest three-digit number with remainder 6 when divided by 9, which is 9-heavy. Then 106: 9*11 +7=106, remainder 7. 107:8, then 108 would be 9*12=108, remainder 0. Then 109:1, 110:2, etc.\n\nTherefore, 105 is the first three-digit number with remainder 6. So 105 is the answer.

The question is asking for the least three-digit number that is \"9-heavy,\" which means when you divide the number by 9, the remainder is greater than 5. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how division with remainder works. Any number divided by 9 will leave a remainder from 0 to 8, right? Because when you divide by a number, the remainder is always less than the divisor. So, for 9-heavy numbers, the remainder has to be more than 5. Specifically, the remainder should be 6, 7, or 8. That narrows it down.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the smallest three-digit number, the first step is to identify the smallest three-digit number in general, which is 100. But we need to check if 100 is 9-heavy. Let's compute 100 divided by 9. \n\nDividing 100 by 9: 9*11 = 99, so 100 divided by 9 is 11 with a remainder of 1. Since 1 is not greater than 5, 100 is not 9-heavy. So, we need to find the next number that is 9-heavy.\n\nSince we're dealing with the smallest three-digit number, let's go step by step. The next number after 100 is 101. Let's check 101 divided by 9. 9*11 is 99, so 101 - 99 = 2. Remainder is 2, still not heavy. 102: 102 - 99 = 3. Remainder 3. 103: 103 - 99 = 4. Remainder 4. 104: 104 - 99 = 5. Remainder 5. Close, but still not heavy. 105: 105 - 9*11=99 is 6. Remainder 6! So 105 divided by 9 leaves a remainder of 6. That's greater than 5, so 105 is 9-heavy. Wait, but let me verify that again.\n\nWait, hold on. If we start from 100, each time we add 1, we check the remainder. Let me confirm the division steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nLet me check 100 divided by 9. 9*11 is 99, 100-99=1. Correct. Then 101: 9*11=99, 101-99=2. 102: 9*11=99, 102-99=3. 103: 9*11=99, 103-99=4. 104: 9*11=99, 104-99=5. 105: 9*12=108, but 105 is less than 108, so 9*11=99, 105-99=6. Yes, remainder 6. So 105 is 9-heavy. Therefore, is 105 the answer? Wait, but let me check if there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe I should verify by another method. Let's compute 105 divided by 9. Let's do the division properly. 9*11=99, 105-99=6. So remainder is 6, which is indeed greater than 5. So 105 is the first three-digit number that is 9-heavy. But wait, is there a number between 100 and 105 that is 9-heavy?\n\nWait, let me check again. The numbers from 100 to 105:\n\n100: remainder 1 (not heavy)\n\n101: 2\n\n102:3\n\n103:4\n\n104:5\n\n105:6\n\nSo, yes, 105 is the first one with a remainder greater than 5. So 105 is the answer. But let me check if maybe 98 is three-digit? No, 98 is two-digit. So 100 is the start. Therefore, 105 is indeed the first three-digit 9-heavy number. Therefore, the answer should be 105.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check.

What is the least three-digit 9-heavy whole number?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the smallest three-digit number that is \"9-heavy.\" The definition says a number is 9-heavy if when you divide it by 9, the remainder is greater than 5. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. A three-digit number means any number from 100 up to 999. A 9-heavy number has a remainder larger than 5 when divided by 9. So, instead of the usual remainders of 0-8, these numbers need to leave a remainder of 6, 7, or 8 when divided by 9. That makes sense.\n\nSo, essentially, I need to find the first three-digit number (starting from 100) such that when divided by 9, the remainder is either 6, 7, or 8. Let me recall how division with remainders works. If a number divided by 9 has a remainder, it means that the number is not a multiple of 9, and the remainder is the leftover after subtracting the largest multiple of 9 less than the number.\n\nLet me start by checking numbers starting from 100 upwards and see if they meet the 9-heavy condition. But maybe there's a smarter way than just checking each number one by one.\n\nLet me think about how numbers relate to their remainders modulo 9. The remainder when dividing by 9 is equivalent to the sum of the digits. This is due to the divisibility rule for 9, but maybe I can use that rule here. However, since we need a remainder greater than 5, maybe it's better to go step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this mathematically. Let me denote the three-digit number as N. Then N = 9k + r, where k is some integer and r is the remainder, which can be 0 to 8. For N to be 9-heavy, r must be 6,7,8. So, N must be congruent to 6,7,8 modulo 9. Therefore, I need to find the smallest N >= 100 such that N \u2261 6,7,8 mod 9.\n\nAlternatively, that means N \u2261 6,7,8 mod 9. So, to find the smallest three-digit number in these congruence classes. Let's check each case.\n\nFirst, let's check if 100 is 9-heavy. 100 divided by 9 is 11 with a remainder of 1 (since 9*11=99, 100-99=1). So remainder is 1, which is less than 5. Therefore, 100 is not 9-heavy.\n\nNext, 101: 101 divided by 9 is 11 with remainder 2 (101-99=2). Not 9-heavy.\n\n102: 102-9*11=102-99=3. Remainder 3. Not 9-heavy.\n\n103: 103-99=4. Remainder 4. Not 9-heavy.\n\n104: 104-99=5. Remainder 5. Still less than 6. Not heavy.\n\n105: 105-9*11=6. Wait, 9*11=99, 105-99=6. So remainder 6. Is 6 greater than 5? Yes. So, 105 would be 9-heavy. But wait, but the problem asks for the least three-digit number. So is 105 the answer? Let me verify.\n\nWait, 105 divided by 9: 9*11=99, 105-99=6. So remainder 6. Since 6 is greater than 5, yes. Therefore, 105 is 9-heavy, and it's the first three-digit number after 100. So is 105 the answer? Let me check the previous numbers again to confirm.\n\nEarlier numbers checked from 100 to 104: remainder 1,2,3,4,5. So 105 is the next. Let me check 105 is three-digit. Yes, 105 is a three-digit number. So, is there a mistake here? Maybe I misread the problem. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\n\"A whole number is said to be '9-heavy' if the remainder when the number is divided by 9 is greater than 5.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what a \"remainder when divided by 9 greater than 5\" means. So, if a number divided by 9 leaves a remainder of 6, 7, or 8, then it's 9-heavy. That makes sense. So, the remainder values we're looking for are 6, 7, or 8.\n\nNow, I need to find the smallest three-digit number where this happens. The smallest three-digit number is 100. Let me check if 100 divided by 9 leaves a remainder greater than 5. Let's calculate 100 divided by 9. 9 times 11 is 99, right? So 100 minus 99 is 1. So the remainder is 1. That's less than 5, so 100 isn't 9-heavy. So I need to check numbers starting from 100 upwards until I find one that when divided by 9 gives a remainder of 6, 7, or 8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to approach this without checking each number. Since division by 9 relates to multiples of 9, perhaps I can find the next number after 100 that is 6,7, or 8 more than a multiple of 9. Let me think.\n\nIf the remainder is greater than 5, then the number is 9k + r, where k is the quotient and r is the remainder (6,7,8). So the smallest three-digit number would be the smallest k such that 9k + r >= 100, with r = 6,7,8.\n\nSo, for each r (6,7,8), solve for k where 9k + r >= 100. Then take the smallest such k and add r to get the number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe even more straightforward: the first three-digit number with remainder >5 when divided by 9. Let's see.\n\nFirst, let me check the remainder when 100 is divided by 9. As before, 100 divided by 9 is 11 with remainder 1. So, the remainder is 1. So, the next numbers:\n\n100: remainder 1\n\n101: remainder 2 (101 - 99 = 2)\n\n102: remainder 3 (102 - 99 = 3)\n\n103: remainder 4 (103 - 99 = 4)\n\n104: remainder 5 (104 - 99 = 5)\n\n105: remainder 6 (105 - 99 = 6). So here, the remainder is 6, which is greater than 5. Wait, so 105 is 9-heavy?\n\nWait, let me check. 105 divided by 9. 9*11=99, 105-99=6. So remainder 6. Yes, that's 9-heavy because 6>5. So is 105 the answer? Wait, but 105 is a three-digit number. Let me verify if there's a smaller three-digit number.\n\nBut let's check 104: remainder 5. 103: remainder 4. 102: 3, 101: 2, 100:1. So 105 is the first one where remainder is 6. Therefore, 105 is the answer?\n\nBut wait, let me check if the question says \"the least three-digit 9-heavy whole number.\" So yes, 105 is the first three-digit number with remainder 6,7,8 when divided by 9. So that should be the answer. But let me confirm once more.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might make a mistake by thinking that \"9-heavy\" might mean the remainder is 9, but 9 is not allowed here because the problem states the remainder is greater than 5, so 6,7,8. So yes, 105 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check 105. Let me verify the division. 9*11=99. 105-99=6. So remainder 6. Yes. So 105 is indeed 9-heavy. So the answer is 105.

What is the least three-digit 9-heavy whole number?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the least three-digit 9-heavy whole number. So, first, I need to understand what exactly a \"9-heavy\" number is. The problem says that when the number is divided by 9, the remainder is greater than 5. So, if we divide the number by 9, the remainder is 6, 7, or 8 to qualify as 9-heavy. The remainder can't be 0-5 because those are the lower remainders. So, the key here is to find the smallest three-digit number where when divided by 9, the remainder is 6, 7, or 8.\n\nLet me start by recalling that any three-digit number must be between 100 and 999. The smallest three-digit number is 100. I need to check if 100 is 9-heavy. Let's divide 100 by 9. 9 times 11 is 99, right? So 99 + 1 = 100. Therefore, the remainder is 1. Since 1 is not greater than 5, 100 is not 9-heavy.\n\nSo, I need to check the next number, 101. 101 divided by 9 is 11 with a remainder. Let's compute that. 9*11 is 99, 101 - 99 = 2. So remainder 2. Still not enough. Moving on to 102. 9*11 is still 99, so 102 - 99 = 3. Remainder 3. Still not greater than 5.\n\n103: 9*11 = 99, 103 - 99 = 4. Remainder 4. Not there yet. 104: 9*11 = 99, remainder 5. Wait, the problem states greater than 5, so remainder 5 is not sufficient. So 104 divided by 9 gives a remainder of 5. Therefore, 104 is not 9-heavy.\n\nMoving to 105: 105 divided by 9. Let's see, 9*11 is 99, 9*12 is 108. So 9*11 = 99. 105 - 99 = 6. So remainder 6. That's greater than 5, right? 6 is greater than 5, so 105 is 9-heavy. Wait, but hold on, let me check my math here again. 9*11 is 99. 105 - 99 is indeed 6. So, 105 divided by 9 is 11 with a remainder of 6. So that's 9-heavy.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm that 105 is indeed the first three-digit number where division by 9 leaves a remainder greater than 5. Let me check the numbers before 105 again step-by-step to make sure I didn't skip any.\n\nStarting from 100:\n\n100: remainder 1\n\n101: 2\n\n102: 3\n\n103: 4\n\n104: 5\n\n105: 6\n\nSo, yes, 105 is the first number after 104 where the remainder is 6, which is greater than 5. Therefore, 105 is a 9-heavy number.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's a number between 100 and 105 where the remainder is 6,7,8. The next possible remainder after 5 is 6. So once we reach a number that gives remainder 6, that's the answer. Let me check 105 as above.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let's think about the remainder when divided by 9. The remainder can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So 9-heavy numbers are those with remainder 6,7,8. Therefore, we can model the problem as finding the smallest three-digit number where (number) mod 9 is in {6,7,8}.\n\nSo, the approach is to find the smallest three-digit number N such that N \u2261 6,7,8 mod 9.\n\nThe minimal three-digit number is 100. Let's compute 100 mod 9. As before, 9*11 = 99, so 100 mod 9 is 1. So 1 is not in {6,7,8}.

The problem is asking for the least three-digit number that's \"9-heavy,\" which means when you divide the number by 9, the remainder is greater than 5. Hmm, so I need to find the smallest three-digit number where the remainder when divided by 9 is either 6, 7, or 8. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall that a three-digit number ranges from 100 to 999. The task is to find the smallest number in this range that satisfies the 9-heavy condition. The condition is that the remainder when divided by 9 is greater than 5, so possible remainders are 6, 7, or 8. \n\nTo find the minimal number, I should start checking from 100 upwards, but that might take too long. Maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think. When a number is divided by 9, the remainder can be written as n = 9*q + r, where q is the quotient and r is the remainder, with 0 \u2264 r < 9. The problem wants r > 5, so r can be 6,7,8. Therefore, the number n can be written as 9*q + 6, 9*q +7, or 9*q +8.\n\nSo, the strategy is to find the smallest n \u2265 100 such that n \u2261 6,7, or 8 mod 9. Let's check for each possible remainder:\n\nStarting with remainder 8. The largest remainder less than 9, which is 8. So numbers like ...8, 17,26,... But since we need the smallest three-digit number, maybe check if 100 divided by 9 gives a remainder, and then adjust accordingly.\n\nWait, let's approach this step by step. Let's compute 100 divided by 9.\n\n100 \u00f7 9: 9*11=99, so 100 = 9*11 +1. So remainder is 1. So 100 leaves a remainder of 1. Then 9^0=1. Hmm. But maybe we can use the formula n = 9q + r, so to find the smallest n \u2265100 with r=6,7,8.\n\nSo let's check if 100 is already 9-heavy. 100 divided by 9 is 11 with a remainder of 1. No, 1 is less than 6, so not 9-heavy.\n\nNext, check 101. 101 \u00f79=11*9=99, remainder 2. Not 9-heavy.\n\n102: 102 \u00f79=11*9=99, remainder 3.\n\n103: remainder 4.\n\n104: remainder 5.\n\n105: remainder 6. Wait, 105 \u00f79=11*9=99, remainder 6. So 105 divided by 9 is 11 with remainder 6. So 105 is 9-heavy.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check 105 again. 9*11=99, 105-99=6. Yes, remainder 6. So 105 is the 9-heavy number here? But is that the case? Let me confirm. The next number after 100 is 105 with remainder 6. So 105 is the first three-digit number where the remainder is 6. So 105 is 9-heavy. Let me check 106 as well to see.\n\n106 \u00f79=11*9=99, remainder 7. So 106 also has a remainder of 7, which is also 9-heavy. 107: remainder 8. So 107 is the first three-digit number with remainder 8. So 105 is the first with remainder 6. Therefore, 105 is the smallest three-digit 9-heavy number. But wait, let me check if between 100 and 105, there's a number that's 9-heavy.\n\nWait, after 100, 101,102,103,104,105, the remainders are 1,2,3,4,5,6. So 105 is the first one with remainder 6.
