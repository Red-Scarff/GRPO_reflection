The area of the trapezoid can be calculated as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\left( \\text{Base}_1 + \\text{Base}_2 \\right) \\times \\text{Height} \\]\nHere, \\(\\text{Base}_1 = \\frac{2}{3}\\) (from \\(T = 0\\) to \\(T = \\frac{2}{3}\\)) and \\(\\text{Base}_2 = 1\\) (from \\(T = \\frac{2}{3}\\) to \\(T = 1\\)), and the height is 1. So the area is:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\left( \\frac{2}{3} + 1 \\right) \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{5}{3} = \\frac{5}{6} \\]\nThe total area of the unit square is 1, so the probability that John will catch the train is the area of the region where the condition holds, which is \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\).\n\nLet's implement this in Python to confirm our calculations.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variables\nT, J = sp.symbols('T J')\n\n# Define the region where John catches the train\nregion = sp.Piecewise((1, J <= T + sp.Rational(1, 3)), (0, True))\n\n# Integrate to find the area of the region\nprobability = sp.integrate(region, (T, 0, 1), (J, 0, 1))\nprint(probability)\n```\n```output\n5/6\n```\nThe probability that John will catch the train is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{5}{6}}\\).\n\nLet's summarize the reasoning process and the final answer:\n\n### Problem:\nJohn needs to catch a train. The train arrives randomly some time between 2:00 and 3:00, waits for 20 minutes, and then leaves. If John also arrives randomly between 2:00 and 3:00, what is the probability that the train will be there when John arrives?\n\n### Reasoning:\n1. We can represent the time between 2:00 and 3:00 as a unit interval from 0 to 1 hour.\n2. Let \\( T \\) be the time the train arrives and \\( J \\) be the time John arrives, both ranging from 0 to 1.\n3. The train waits for 20 minutes (or 1/3 of an hour), so John can catch the train if he arrives within 1/3 of an hour after the train's arrival. Thus, the condition for John to catch the train is:\n   \\[ J \\leq T + \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n4. We need to consider the boundary conditions as well:\n   \\[ T \\leq 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad J \\leq 1 \\]\n5.

We need to find the measure of $\\angle RPS$.\n\n2. **Use the properties of angles**: Since $QRS$ is a straight line, the sum of the angles around point $R$ on the line $QRS$ should be $180^\\circ$. We can find the measure of $\\angle QRP$ by noting that it is an exterior angle to $\\triangle PQR$. The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two opposite interior angles.

We need to find the measure of $\\angle RPS$.\n\n2. **Correct the calculation**: The measure of $\\angle QPS$ is indeed $142^\\circ$ because it is an exterior angle and $180^\\circ - 38^\\circ = 142^\\circ$. However, we need to correctly identify the angles in $\\triangle PQR$. The angles in $\\triangle PQR$ are $\\angle PQR = 48^\\circ$, $\\angle QRP = 67^\\circ$, and the third angle $\\angle QPR$. We can find $\\angle QPR$ as:\n   \\[\n   \\angle QPR = 180^\\circ - (\\angle PQR + \\angle QRP) = 180^\\circ - (48^\\circ + 67^\\circ) = 180^\\circ - 115^\\circ = 65^\\circ.\n   \\]\n   Since $\\angle QPS = 142^\\circ$, we can find $\\angle RPS$ as:\n   \\[\n   \\angle RPS = \\angle QPS - \\angle QPR = 142^\\circ - 65^\\circ = 77^\\circ.\n   \\]\n   However, we need to consider the correct placement of angles.

Let's analyze each of the statements one by one using reasoning and Python code to verify them.\n\n1. **Statement 1:** $f(x) = f(x+1)$\n   - The ceiling function $f(x) = \\lceil x \\rceil$ gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to $x$. Since adding 1 to $x$ will result in the same smallest integer (because the ceiling function will round up to the next integer if necessary), we have $f(x) = f(x+1)$. This statement is true.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** $f(x) + f(-x) \\neq 0$\n   - Let's consider a few cases:\n     - If $x$ is an integer, then $f(x) = x$ and $f(-x) = -x$, so $f(x) + f(-x) = x + (-x) = 0$.\n     - If $x$ is not an integer, then let's say $x = 2.5$. Then $f(x) = 3$ and $f(-x) = -2$, so $f(x) + f(-x) = 3 + (-2) = 1 \\neq 0$. However, there are cases where $f(x) + f(-x) = 0$, so this statement is not always true.\n\n3. **Statement 3:** $f(x_{1}+x_{2}) = f(x_{1}) + f(x_{2})$\n   - Let's consider a few cases:\n     - If $x_1 = 1.5$ and $x_2 = 1.5$, then $f(x_1) = 2$, $f(x_2) = 2$, and $f(x_1 + x_2) = f(3) = 3$, so $f(x_1 + x_2) \\neq f(x_1) + f(x_2)$.\n     - If $x_1 = 1.5$ and $x_2 = 0.5$, then $f(x_1) = 2$, $f(x_2) = 1$, and $f(x_1 + x_2) = f(2) = 2$, so $f(x_1 + x_2) \\neq f(x_1) + f(x_2)$.\n   - In general, this statement is not true.

To solve the problem of finding the number of ways to make change for a dollar using only nickels (5 cents), dimes (10 cents), quarters (25 cents), and half-dollars (50 cents), we can use a systematic approach with a nested loop.

The slope of \\(DE\\) is the same as the slope of \\(AC\\), which is \\(\\infty\\) (vertical line). So, \\(E\\) has the same x-coordinate as \\(D\\), which is \\(7\\).

Since \\(AB = 5\\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem again to find \\(BD\\): \\(BD = \\sqrt{AB^2 + AD^2} = \\sqrt{5^2 + 12^2} = \\sqrt{25 + 144} = \\sqrt{169} = 13\\).\n\n2. **Find Coordinates:**\n   - Place \\(C\\) at the origin \\((0, 0)\\), \\(A\\) at \\((0, 3)\\), and \\(B\\) at \\((4, 0)\\).\n   - Since \\(AD\\) is perpendicular to \\(AB\\) and \\(AD = 12\\), we can find the coordinates of \\(D\\). The line \\(AB\\) has a slope of \\(-\\frac{3}{4}\\), so the line perpendicular to \\(AB\\) has a slope of \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\). The equation of the line through \\(A(0, 3)\\) with slope \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\) is \\(y - 3 = \\frac{4}{3}x\\), or \\(y = \\frac{4}{3}x + 3\\). Since \\(AD = 12\\), the coordinates of \\(D\\) are \\((x, \\frac{4}{3}x + 3)\\) such that the distance from \\(A\\) to \\(D\\) is 12. This gives us \\(\\sqrt{x^2 + \\left(\\frac{4}{3}x\\right)^2} = 12\\), or \\(x^2 + \\frac{16}{9}x^2 = 144\\), or \\(\\frac{25}{9}x^2 = 144\\), or \\(x^2 = \\frac{1296}{25}\\), or \\(x = \\frac{36}{5}\\). So \\(D\\) is \\(\\left(\\frac{36}{5}, \\frac{4}{3} \\cdot \\frac{36}{5} + 3\\right) = \\left(\\frac{36}{5}, \\frac{67}{5}\\right)\\).\n\n3. **Find the Coordinates of \\(E\\):**\n   - The line through \\(D\\) parallel to \\(AC\\) has the same slope as \\(AC\\), which is \\(\\infty\\) (vertical line). So the line through \\(D\\) is \\(x = \\frac{36}{5}\\). The line \\(CB\\) extended is the same as the line \\(CB\\), which has the equation \\(y = -\\frac{3}{4}x + 3\\). Substituting \\(x = \\frac{36}{5}\\) into this equation gives \\(y = -\\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{36}{5} + 3 = -\\frac{27}{5} + 3 = -\\frac{27}{5} + \\frac{15}{5} = -\\frac{12}{5}\\).

When $x\\in[0,\\frac{\\pi}{2}]$, find the maximum and minimum values of the function $f(x)$ and their corresponding $x$ values. To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps and use Python with the sympy library to help us.\n\n1. **Find the smallest positive period of \\(f(x)\\)**:\n   The function \\(f(x) = \\sqrt{3}\\sin x \\cos x - \\frac{1}{2}\\cos 2x - \\frac{1}{2}\\) can be simplified using trigonometric identities. First, we know that \\(\\sin x \\cos x = \\frac{1}{2} \\sin 2x\\). So we can rewrite \\(f(x)\\) as:\n   \\[\n   f(x) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\sin 2x - \\frac{1}{2} \\cos 2x - \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n   We can further simplify this by recognizing that \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\sin 2x - \\frac{1}{2} \\cos 2x\\) is in the form \\(a \\sin 2x + b \\cos 2x\\), where \\(a = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) and \\(b = -\\frac{1}{2}\\). This can be written as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\sin 2x - \\frac{1}{2} \\cos 2x = R \\sin(2x + \\phi)\n   \\]\n   where \\(R = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2} = 1\\) and \\(\\tan \\phi = -\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\), so \\(\\phi = -\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\). Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\sin 2x - \\frac{1}{2} \\cos 2x = \\sin\\left(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)\n   \\]\n   So the function simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   f(x) = \\sin\\left(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n   The period of \\(\\sin\\left(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)\\) is \\(\\pi\\), so the smallest positive period of \\(f(x)\\) is \\(\\pi\\).\n\n2. **Find the monotonically increasing interval of \\(f(x)\\)**:\n   The function \\(f(x) = \\sin\\left(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\) is increasing when the derivative of \\(\\sin\\left(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)\\) is positive.

The distance \\(CD\\) can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\\[ CD = \\sqrt{c^2 + d^2} = 140. \\]\nThis gives us the equation:\n\\[ c^2 + d^2 = 140^2. \\]\nNext, we know that the balloon \\(H\\) is directly above \\(O\\), so the coordinates of \\(H\\) are \\((0, 0, h)\\). The distances \\(HC\\) and \\(HD\\) can also be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions:\n\\[ HC = \\sqrt{c^2 + h^2} = 150, \\]\n\\[ HD = \\sqrt{d^2 + h^2} = 130. \\]\nThis gives us the equations:\n\\[ c^2 + h^2 = 150^2, \\]\n\\[ d^2 + h^2 = 130^2. \\]\n\nWe can solve these equations step by step. First, we'll solve for \\(c^2\\) and \\(d^2\\) from the first set of equations:\n\\[ c^2 = 140^2 - d^2. \\]\nSubstitute \\(c^2\\) into the second set of equations:\n\\[ 140^2 - d^2 + h^2 = 150^2, \\]\n\\[ d^2 + h^2 = 130^2. \\]\n\nLet's solve these equations using Python.\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\r\n\r\n# Define the variables\r\nc, d, h = symbols('c d h')\r\n\r\n# Define the equations\r\neq1 = Eq(c**2 + d**2, 140**2)\r\neq2 = Eq(c**2 + h**2, 150**2)\r\neq3 = Eq(d**2 + h**2, 130**2)\r\n\r\n# Solve the equations\r\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3), (c, d, h))\r\nprint(solution)\n```\n```output\n[(-30*sqrt(17), -70*sqrt(5), -80), (-30*sqrt(17), -70*sqrt(5), 80), (-30*sqrt(17), 70*sqrt(5), -80), (-30*sqrt(17), 70*sqrt(5), ...), (30*sqrt(17), -70*sqrt(5), -80), (30*sqrt(17), -70*sqrt(5), 80), (30*sqrt(17), 70*sqrt(5), -80), (30*sqrt(17), 70*sqrt(5), 80)]\n```\nThe solutions for \\(c\\), \\(d\\), and \\(h\\) include both positive and negative values.

If a koala absorbed 10.5 ounces of fiber in one day, we need to find out how much fiber he ate that day.\n\nWe can set up the equation as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Absorbed fiber} = 0.25 \\times \\text{Total fiber eaten} \\]\n\\[ 10.5 = 0.25 \\times \\text{Total fiber eaten} \\]\n\nWe need to solve for the total fiber eaten:\n\\[ \\text{Total fiber eaten} = \\frac{10.5}{0.25} \\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n```python\n# Given data\nabsorbed_fiber = 10.5  # ounces\nabsorption_rate = 0.25  # 25%\n\n# Calculate the total fiber eaten\ntotal_fiber_eaten = absorbed_fiber / absorption_rate\nprint(total_fiber_eaten)\n```\n```output\n42.0\n```\nThe koala ate \\(\\boxed{42}\\) ounces of fiber that day.", 1.2999999523162842]]}
