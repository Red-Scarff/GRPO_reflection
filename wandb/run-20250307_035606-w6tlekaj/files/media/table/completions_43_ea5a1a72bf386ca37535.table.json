Finally, we multiply the result by 16.\n\nLet's do this step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Find a common denominator\n\nThe denominators of the fractions are 2, 4, 16, and 16. The least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers is 16. So we convert each fraction to have a denominator of 16:\n\n- \\(\\frac{125}{2} = \\frac{125 \\times 8}{2 \\times 8} = \\frac{1000}{16}\\)\n- \\(\\frac{25}{4} = \\frac{25 \\times 4}{4 \\times 4} = \\frac{100}{16}\\)\n- \\(\\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{9}{16}\\)\n- \\(1 = \\frac{16}{16}\\)\n\nNow we can add these fractions together:\n\\[\n\\frac{1000}{16} + \\frac{100}{16} + \\frac{9}{16} + \\frac{16}{16} = \\frac{1000 + 100 + 9 + 16}{16} = \\frac{1125}{16}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Multiply by 16\n\nNow we need to multiply \\(\\frac{1125}{16}\\) by 16:\n\\[\n16 \\times \\frac{1125}{16} = 1125\n\\]\n\nSo the final answer is \\(1125\\).\n\nLet's confirm this with Python code to ensure accuracy.\n```python\n# Given expression\nexpression = 16 * (125/2 + 25/4 + 9/16 + 1)\n\n# Final result\nprint(expression)\n```\n```output\n1125.0\n```\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{1125}\\).\n\nJoan is answering English and Math exams with 30 and 15 questions, respectively.

The cost to connect house $i$ to house $j$ is represented by $c_{ij}$, with $c_{ij} = c_{ji}$ (symmetric costs) and $c_{ii} = 0$ (no cost to connect a house to itself).\n\nGiven the costs $c_{ij}$ for all $1 \\leq i, j \\leq N$, determine the minimum cost to connect all the houses in such a way that every house is connected to at least one other house. Assume that it is always possible to connect the houses under these conditions.\n\nFormally, find the minimum total cost of connecting all houses in the well such that there are no isolated houses.\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal connections to minimize the total cost. This can be approached using the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm, specifically the Kruskal's algorithm, which is efficient for finding the MST in a graph.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Initialization:\n   - Define a set of edges $E = \\{(i, j, c_{ij})\\}$ where $i < j$ and calculate their costs $c_{ij}$.\n   - Sort all edges in non-decreasing order of their costs.\n\n2. Kruskal's Algorithm:\n   - Initialize a graph with $N$ vertices (houses) and no edges.\n   - Iterate through the sorted edge list:\n     - Select the edge with the lowest cost that does not form a cycle with the edges already in the MST.\n     - Add the selected edge to the MST.\n\n3. Identify the MST:\n   - Continue until there are $N-1$ edges in the MST, ensuring all houses are connected without forming any cycles.\n\n4. Calculate the Total Cost:\n   - Sum the costs of the edges in the MST.\n\n### Detailed Explantion:\n\nGiven the costs $c_{ij}$ for all $1 \\leq i, j \\leq N$, the problem can be modeled as constructing the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for the graph where vertices represent the houses and edges represent the connectivity with their corresponding costs.\n\nTo find the MST:\n- Step 1: Sort all edges in non-decreasing order of their costs. This ensures that we always consider the cheapest connections first.\n- Step 2: Start with no edges and iterate through the sorted list. For each edge $(i, j, c_{ij})$, add it to the MST if it does not form a cycle with the edges already in the MST.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n1. **Understand the Function:**\n   The function $f(x) = x^k$ with $k < 0$ means that $k$ is a negative number. As $x$ increases, $x^k$ decreases because any number greater than 1 raised to a negative power is a fraction between 0 and 1.\n\n2. **Evaluate at the Boundary Points:**\n   - At $x = 1$, $f(1) = 1^k = 1$.\n   - As $x \\to \\infty$, $f(x) = x^k \\to 0$ because any number greater than 1 raised to a negative power approaches 0 as the exponent becomes more negative.\n\n3. **Determine the Range:**\n   Since $f(x) = x^k$ is a continuous function for $k < 0$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$ and $x^k$ decreases monotonically from 1 to 0 as $x$ increases from 1 to $\\infty$, the range of $f(x)$ is $(0, 1]$.\n\nLet's confirm this with a bit of Python code using sympy to verify the behavior of the function $f(x) = x^k$ for $k < 0$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variables\nx, k = sp.symbols('x k', real=True)\nf = x**k\n\n# Define the interval\ninterval = (x, 1, sp.oo)\n\n# Evaluate the function at the boundary points\nf_at_1 = f.subs(x, 1)  # at x = 1\nf_at_infinity = sp.limit(f, x, sp.oo)  # as x approaches infinity\n\n# Display the results\nprint(f_at_1, f_at_infinity)\n```\n```output\nNotImplementedError: Not sure of sign of k\n```\nIt looks like the code encountered an issue because it's not sure of the sign of \\(k\\). We can handle this by explicitly stating that \\(k\\) is negative. Let's modify the code to reflect this and verify the range of the function \\(f(x) = x^k\\) for \\(k < 0\\) on the interval \\([1, \\infty)\\).\n\nHere's the revised code:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variables\nx, k = sp.symbols('x k', real=True)\nf = x**k\n\n# Define the interval\ninterval = (x, 1, sp.oo)\n\n# Evaluate the function at the boundary points\nf_at_1 = f.subs(x, 1)  # at x = 1\nf_at_infinity = sp.limit(f, x, sp.oo)  # as x approaches infinity\n\n# Assume k is negative\nf_at_infinity_assumed = sp.limit(f, x, sp.oo, dir='-')\n\n# Display the results\nprint(f_at_1, f_at_infinity_assumed)\n```\n```output\nNotImplementedError: Not sure of sign of k\n```\nThe issue arises because the symbolic limit function in sympy is not handling the negative sign of \\(k\\) automatically.
