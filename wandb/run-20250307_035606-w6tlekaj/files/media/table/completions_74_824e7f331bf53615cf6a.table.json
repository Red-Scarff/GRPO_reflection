Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Odd Function Property**: Since $f(x)$ is an odd function, we know that $f(-x) = -f(x)$. This property will help us to extend the monotonicity to the entire real line.\n\n2. **Monotonicity**: Because $f(x)$ is monotonically increasing in $[0, +\\infty)$, it is also monotonically increasing on $(-\\infty, 0]$. Hence, $f(x)$ is monotonically increasing over the entire real line.\n\n3. **Inequality Transformation**: Given that $f(2x-1) > f(1)$ and $f(x)$ is monotonically increasing, we can directly compare the arguments of the function: $2x - 1 > 1$.

Here, the coefficients are:\n   - \\( a = 1 \\) (coefficient of \\( x^2 \\))\n   - \\( b = 11 \\) (coefficient of \\( x \\))\n   - \\( c = -5 \\) (constant term)\n\n2. **Complete the square**:\n   - To complete the square, we need to rewrite the quadratic function in the form \\( (x + h)^2 = x^2 + 2hx + h^2 \\).\n   - The term \\( 11x \\) corresponds to the \\( 2hx \\) term where \\( 2h = 11 \\). Solving for \\( h \\), we get \\( h = \\frac{11}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Determine the vertex**:\n   - By setting \\( x + \\frac{11}{2} = 0 \\), we get \\( x = -\\frac{11}{2} \\).\n   - This value of \\( x \\) corresponds to the vertex of the parabola, which is the minimum point since the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is positive (the parabola opens upwards).\n\nLet's verify this using Python code and then substitute \\( x \\) back into the original equation to find the corresponding minimum value.\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\r\n\r\n# Define the variable and the function\r\nx = sp.symbols('x')\r\nf = x**2 + 11*x - 5\r\n\r\n# Find the critical points by solving the derivative of the function\r\nf_prime = sp.diff(f, x)\r\ncritical_points = sp.solve(f_prime, x)\r\n\r\n# Calculate the second derivative to verify if it's a minimum\r\nf_double_prime = sp.diff(f_prime, x)\r\n\r\n# Verify the critical points and find the minimum value\r\ncritical_values = [(point, f.subs(x, point)) for point in critical_points]\r\nis_minimum = [(point, f_double_prime.subs(x, point) > 0) for point in critical_points]\r\n\r\nprint((critical_values, is_minimum))\n```\n```output\n([(-11/2, -141/4)], [(-11/2, True)])\n```\nThe critical point of the function \\( f(x) = x^2 + 11x - 5 \\) is at \\( x = -\\frac{11}{2} \\). Evaluating the function at this point, we get:\n\n\\[\nf\\left(-\\frac{11}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{141}{4}\n\\]\n\nThe second derivative test confirms that this point is indeed a minimum since \\( f''(x) = 2 \\), which is positive.\n\nThus, the value of \\( x \\) that gives the minimum value for \\( x^2 + 11x - 5 \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-\\frac{11}{2}}\n\\]", 1.4900000095367432], ["40", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.
