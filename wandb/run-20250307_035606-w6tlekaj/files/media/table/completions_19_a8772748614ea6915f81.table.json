These cases are:\n\n1. $x \\geq 60$ and $y \\geq 0$\n2. $x \\geq 60$ and $y < 0$\n3. $x < 60$ and $y \\geq 0$\n4. $x < 60$ and $y < 0$\n\nLet's analyze each case separately:\n\n1. For $x \\geq 60$ and $y \\geq 0$:\n   \\[\n   x - 60 + y = \\frac{x}{4} \\implies 4x - 240 + 4y = x \\implies 3x + 4y = 240.\n   \\]\n   When $x = 60$, $y = 15$ and when $x = 80$, $y = 0$. So this case gives a line segment from $(60, 15)$ to $(80, 0)$.\n\n2. For $x \\geq 60$ and $y < 0$:\n   \\[\n   x - 60 - y = \\frac{x}{4} \\implies 4x - 240 - 4y = x \\implies 3x - 4y = 240.\n   \\]\n   When $x = 60$, $y = -15$ and when $x = 80$, $y = 0$. So this case gives a line segment from $(60, -15)$ to $(80, 0)$.\n\n3. For $x < 60$ and $y \\geq 0$:\n   \\[\n   60 - x + y = \\frac{x}{4} \\implies -4x + 240 + 4y = x \\implies -5x + 4y = -240 \\implies 5x - 4y = 240.\n   \\]\n   When $x = 48$, $y = 30$ and when $x = 60$, $y = 0$. So this case gives a line segment from $(48, 30)$ to $(60, 0)$.\n\n4. For $x < 60$ and $y < 0$:\n   \\[\n   60 - x - y = \\frac{x}{4} \\implies -4x + 240 - 4y = x \\implies -5x - 4y = -240 \\implies 5x + 4y = 240.\n   \\]\n   When $x = 48$, $y = -30$ and when $x = 60$, $y = 0$. So this case gives a line segment from $(48, -30)$ to $(60, 0)$.\n\nThese four line segments form a kite-shaped region. The vertices of the kite are $(60, 0)$, $(80, 0)$, $(48, 30)$, and $(48, -30)$. The area of the kite can be calculated using the formula for the area of a kite, which is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times d_1 \\times d_2$, where $d_1$ and $d_2$ are the lengths of the diagonals.\n\nThe length of the horizontal diagonal is $80 - 48 = 32$ and the length of the vertical diagonal is $30 - (-30) = 60$.

The roots are given by the quadratic formula:\n\\[ z = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{-3}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}. \\]\nSo, the roots are \\( z = \\frac{-1 + i\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\) and \\( z = \\frac{-1 - i\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\).\n\nNext, we need to use the fact that \\(z\\) satisfies \\(z^2 + z + 1 = 0\\), which implies \\(z^2 = -z - 1\\).

Melissa has 3 shoes to repair, so the total time spent is 3 * 20 = 60 minutes.\n\nWe can write a Python code to confirm this calculation.\n```python\n# Time to replace the buckle of one shoe\ntime_buckle = 5\n\n# Time to even out the heel of one shoe\ntime_heel = 15\n\n# Total time to repair one shoe\ntime_per_shoe = time_buckle + time_heel\n\n# Number of shoes to repair\nnum_shoes = 3\n\n# Total time to repair all shoes\ntotal_time = num_shoes * time_per_shoe\nprint(total_time)\n```\n```output\n60\n```\nThe total time Melissa spends on repairing her shoes is \\(\\boxed{60}\\) minutes.\n\nIf $y = 88x$ and $\\dfrac", 0.30000001192092896], ["10", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n1. **17**: The only divisors of 17 are 1 and 17.

Therefore, 57 is not a prime number.\n6. **67**: The only divisors of 67 are 1 and 67. Therefore, 67 is a prime number.\n7. **77**: The number 77 is divisible by 7 (since \\(77 = 7 \\times 11\\)). Therefore, 77 is not a prime number.\n8. **87**: The number 87 is divisible by 3 (since \\(8 + 7 = 15\\), which is divisible by 3).

The sum of all the coefficients of \\((1 + ix)^{2009}\\) when \\(x = -1\\) is \\((1 - i)^{2009}\\).\n3. The real part of \\((1 + i)^{2009}\\) plus the real part of \\((1 - i)^{2009}\\) will give us twice the sum of the real coefficients (since the imaginary parts will cancel out).\n\nFirst, let's calculate \\((1 + i)\\) and \\((1 - i)\\) in polar form:\n\\[1 + i = \\sqrt{2} \\left(\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{4} + i\\sin\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\]\n\\[1 - i = \\sqrt{2} \\left(\\cos\\frac{-\\pi}{4} + i\\sin\\frac{-\\pi}{4}\\right)\\]\n\nUsing De Moivre's theorem, we can raise these to the 2009th power:\n\\[(1 + i)^{2009} = (\\sqrt{2})^{2009} \\left(\\cos\\frac{2009\\pi}{4} + i\\sin\\frac{2009\\pi}{4}\\right)\\]\n\\[(1 - i)^{2009} = (\\sqrt{2})^{2009} \\left(\\cos\\frac{-2009\\pi}{4} + i\\sin\\frac{-2009\\pi}{4}\\right)\\]\n\nSince \\(\\cos(-\\theta) = \\cos(\\theta)\\) and \\(\\sin(-\\theta) = -\\sin(\\theta)\\), the real parts of \\((1 + i)^{2009}\\) and \\((1 - i)^{2009}\\) are the same. So the sum of the real coefficients is the real part of \\((1 + i)^{2009}\\) plus the real part of \\((1 - i)^{2009}\\), which is twice the real part of \\((1 + i)^{2009}\\).\n\nLet's calculate the real part of \\((1 + i)^{2009}\\):\n\\[\\frac{2009\\pi}{4} = 502\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\]\nSo,\n\\[\\cos\\frac{2009\\pi}{4} = \\cos\\left(502\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\cos\\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\]\nThus,\n\\[(1 + i)^{2009} = (\\sqrt{2})^{2009} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + i\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = 2^{1004.5} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + i\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = 2^{1004} (1 + i)\\]\nThe real part of \\((1 + i)^{2009}\\) is \\(2^{1004}\\). Therefore, the sum of the real coefficients is \\(2 \\cdot 2^{1004} = 2^{1005}\\).\n\nFinally, we need to find \\(\\log_2(2^{1005})\\):\n\\[\\log_2(2^{1005}) = 1005\\]\n\nLet's verify the calculations using Python and sympy:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the expression (1 + ix)^2009\nx = sp.symbols('x')\nexpr = (1 + sp.I*x)**2009\n\n# Substitute x = 1 and x = -1 and sum the real parts\nreal_sum = sp.re(expr.subs(x, 1)) + sp.re(expr.subs(x, -1))\n\n# The real part of (1 + i)^2009 is 2^", 0.20999999344348907]]}
