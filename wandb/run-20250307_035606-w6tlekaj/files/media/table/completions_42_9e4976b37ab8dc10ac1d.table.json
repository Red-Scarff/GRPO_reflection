Since 1000 = $2^3 \\cdot 5^3$, the sequence $2^n \\mod 1000$ will eventually cycle due to the periodicity introduced by the factors of 5 and 2. However, since we are only interested in powers of 2, the cycle will be determined by the powers of 2 modulo 125 (since the powers of 2 modulo 8 are trivial and will not affect the cycle length modulo 1000).\n\nThe order of 2 modulo 125 (i.e., the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $2^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{125}$) is 100 because $\\phi(125) = 100$ and 2 is a primitive root modulo 125. This means the sequence $2^n \\mod 125$ repeats every 100 terms. Since the powers of 2 modulo 8 are 1, 2, 4, 0, 0, ..., the full cycle modulo 1000 will be the same every 100 terms.\n\nThus, the set of distinct remainders is the set of remainders of $2^n$ for $0 \\leq n < 100$ modulo 1000. We can compute this set and then find the sum of these distinct remainders. Finally, we will find the remainder when this sum is divided by 1000.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n```python\n# Calculate the set of distinct remainders when 2^n is divided by 1000 for 0 <= n < 100\nremainders = set()\nfor n in range(100):\n    remainders.add(pow(2, n, 1000))\n\n# Calculate the sum of the distinct remainders\nsum_remainders = sum(remainders)\n\n# Find the remainder when the sum is divided by 1000\nresult = sum_remainders % 1000\nprint(result)\n```\n```output\n375\n```\nThe remainder when the sum of all distinct remainders when $2^n$ is divided by 1000 (for nonnegative integer $n$) is divided by 1000 is \\(\\boxed{375}\\).", 0.0], ["20", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

This implies that the complex roots of the polynomial must occur in conjugate pairs. Given that $2i$ and $2+i$ are roots of the polynomial, their conjugates $-2i$ and $2-i$ must also be roots. Let the fifth root be $r$. Therefore, the polynomial can be written as:\n\\[ f(x) = (x-2i)(x+2i)(x-(2+i))(x-(2-i))(x-r). \\]\nWe can simplify the factors involving the complex roots:\n\\[ (x-2i)(x+2i) = x^2 + 4, \\]\n\\[ (x-(2+i))(x-(2-i)) = (x-2-i)(x-2+i) = (x-2)^2 + 1 = x^2 - 4x + 5. \\]\nThus, the polynomial becomes:\n\\[ f(x) = (x^2 + ", 0.44999998807907104], ["20", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Analyze the factors to determine the number of positive real solutions.\n\nLet's start by factoring the polynomial:\n\n\\[ x^6(x^4 + 7x^3 + 14x^2 + 1729x - 1379) = 0. \\]\n\nThis gives us one factor of $x^6$ and another factor of the polynomial $x^4 + 7x^3 + 14x^2 + 1729x - 1379$. Since $x^6 = 0$ has only one solution at $x = 0$, which is not a positive real number, we only need to consider the polynomial $x^4 + 7x^3 + 14x^2 + 1729x - 1379$ for positive real solutions.\n\nNext, we need to determine if the polynomial $x^4 + 7x^3 + 14x^2 + 1729x - 1379$ has any positive real roots. We can use Descartes' Rule of Signs, which states that the number of positive real roots of a polynomial is either equal to the number of sign changes between consecutive coefficients, or less than that by a multiple of 2.\n\nThe polynomial $x^4 + 7x^3 + 14x^2 + 1729x - 1379$ has one sign change (from +1729x to -1379), so it has exactly one positive real root.\n\nTherefore, the number of positive real solutions to the original equation is 1.\n\nLet's verify this using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Define the polynomial coefficients\ncoefficients = [1, 7, 14, 1729, -1379]\n\n# Find the roots of the polynomial\nroots = np.roots(coefficients)\npositive_real_roots = [root for root in roots if np.isreal(root) and root > 0]\n\n# Output the number of positive real solutions\nnum_positive_real_solutions = len(positive_real_roots)\nprint(num_positive_real_solutions)\n```\n```output\n1\n```\nThe number of positive real solutions to the equation $x^{10} + 7x^9 + 14x^8 + 1729x^7 - 1379x^6 = 0$ is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).", 1.2100000381469727], ["20", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Let's break down the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Understand the Polynomial:**\n   The polynomial \\(x^6 - x^5 + x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x + 1\\) is a special polynomial known as a cyclotomic polynomial. It can be factored into quadratic factors over the reals.\n\n2. **Form of the Factors:**\n   The polynomial can be factored as \\((x^2 + b_1 x + c_1)(x^2 + b_2 x + c_2)(x^2 + b_3 x + c_3)\\). To find the coefficients, we can use the fact that the roots of the polynomial \\(x^6 - x^5 + x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x + 1 = 0\\) are the 7th roots of unity (excluding 1).\n\n3. **Roots of Unity:**\n   The 7th roots of unity are \\(1, \\omega, \\omega^2, \\omega^3, \\omega^4, \\omega^5, \\omega^6\\), where \\(\\omega = e^{2\\pi i / 7}\\).

The pairs can be chosen as \\((\\omega, \\omega^6)\\), \\((\\omega^2, \\omega^5)\\), and \\((\\omega^3, \\omega^4)\\). The quadratic factors are then:\n   \\[\n   (x - \\omega)(x - \\omega^6) = x^2 - (\\omega + \\omega^6)x + \\omega \\cdot \\omega^6 = x^2 - (\\omega + \\omega^6)x + 1,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (x - \\omega^2)(x - \\omega^5) = x^2 - (\\omega^2 + \\omega^5)x + \\omega^2 \\cdot \\omega^5 = x^2 - (\\omega^2 + \\omega^5)x + 1,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (x - \\omega^3)(x - \\omega^4) = x^2 - (\\omega^3 + \\omega^4)x + \\omega^3 \\cdot \\omega^4 = x^2 - (\\omega^3 + \\omega^4)x + 1.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Coefficients:**\n   The coefficients \\(b_1, b_2, b_3\\) are \\(-(\\omega + \\omega^6)\\), \\(-(\\omega^2 + \\omega^5)\\), and \\(-(\\omega^3 + \\omega^4)\\), respectively. The coefficients \\(c_1, c_2, c_3\\) are all 1. Therefore, \\(b_1 c_1 + b_2 c_2 + b_3 c_3 = -(\\omega + \\omega^6) - (\\omega^2 + \\omega^5) - (\\omega^3 + \\omega^4)\\).\n\n6. **Sum of the Roots:**\n   The sum of the roots of the polynomial \\(x^6 - x^5 + x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x + 1 = 0\\) is given by the coefficient of \\(x^5\\), which is -1. Therefore, \\(\\omega + \\omega^2 + \\omega^3 + \\omega^4 + \\omega^5 + \\omega^6 = 1\\).
