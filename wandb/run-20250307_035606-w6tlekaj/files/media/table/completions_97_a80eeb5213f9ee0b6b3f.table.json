Let's assume the initial stock of ornamental rings before Eliza bought more was \\( x \\). After Eliza's purchase, the total stock becomes \\( x + 400 \\).\n2. According to the problem, the 400 rings Eliza bought is twice the number of the remaining stock (initial stock \\( x \\)). So we have the equation \\( 400 = 2x \\). Solving for \\( x \\), we get \\( x = 200 \\). So the total stock after Eliza's purchase is \\( 200 + 400 = 600 \\) rings.\n3. After selling half of the total stock, the remaining stock is \\( \\frac{600}{2} = 300 \\) rings.\n4. Then, Eliza's mother buys 200 more rings, so the new total stock is \\( 300 + 200 = 500 \\) rings.\n5.

We need to find the value of \\( x \\).\n\n### Step 2: Prime Factorization of Given Factors\nLet's start by finding the prime factorizations of 12 and 15:\n- \\( 12 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\)\n- \\( 15 = 3 \\times 5 \\)\n\nSince both 12 and 15 are factors of \\( x \\), the prime factors of \\( x \\) must include at least \\( 2^2 \\), \\( 3 \\), and \\( 5 \\). So, \\( x \\) must be of the form \\( 2^a \\times 3^b \\times 5^c \\times \\text{other primes} \\), where \\( a \\geq 2 \\), \\( b \\geq 1 \\), and \\( c \\geq 1 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Number of Divisors\nThe number of divisors of \\( x = 2^a \\times 3^b \\times 5^c \\times \\text{other primes} \\) is given by the formula \\((a+1)(b+1)(c+1) \\cdots\\). We know that this product must equal 12.\n\n### Step 4: Possible Factor Combinations\nThe number 12 can be factored into:\n- \\( 12 = 12 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\)\n- \\( 12 = 6 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\)\n- \\( 12 = 4 \\times 3 \\times 1 \\)\n- \\( 12 = 3 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\)\n- \\( 12 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\)\n\nGiven \\( a \\geq 2 \\), \\( b \\geq 1 \\), and \\( c \\geq 1 \\), the viable combinations are:\n- \\( a+1 = 4 \\), \\( b+1 = 3 \\), \\( c+1 = 1 \\) which gives \\( a = 3 \\), \\( b = 2 \\), \\( c = 0 \\) (not valid because \\( c \\) must be at least 1)\n- \\( a+1 = 3 \\), \\( b+1 = 2 \\), \\( c+1 = 2 \\) which gives \\( a = 2 \\), \\( b = 1 \\), \\( c = 1 \\)\n\nSo, the only valid form for \\( x \\) is \\( 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 = 4 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 60 \\).\n\n### Step 5: Verification\nLet's verify that 60 has 12 divisors:\n- The divisors of 60 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60.

First, let's break down the problem into smaller parts.\n2. We know that 12 and 15 are factors of \\(x\\). The prime factorizations of 12 and 15 are:\n   \\[\n   12 = 2^2 \\times 3\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   15 = 3 \\times 5\n   \\]\n3. Since both 12 and 15 are factors of \\(x\\), \\(x\\) must include all the prime factors from both numbers. So, \\(x\\) must have at least \\(2^2\\), \\(3\\), and \\(5\\) in its prime factorization.\n4. Next, we need to find the smallest number \\(x\\) that has 12 positive factors and includes the prime factors \\(2^2\\), \\(3\\), and \\(5\\). The formula for the number of factors of a number \\(x = p_1^{e_1} \\times p_2^{e_2} \\times \\ldots \\times p_k^{e_k}\\) is \\((e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\ldots (e_k + 1)\\). We need this product to be 12. The possible combinations of exponents that give 12 factors are:\n   \\[\n   12 = 12 \\times 1\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   12 = 6 \\times 2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   12 = 4 \\times 3\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   12 = 3 \\times 2 \\times 2\n   \\]\n5. The smallest possible number \\(x\\) that fits the prime factors \\(2^2\\), \\(3\\), and \\(5\\) and has 12 factors is likely to be a product of the smallest possible exponents. Let's check each combination:\n   - For \\(12 = 12 \\times 1\\), \\(x = p_1^{11}\\) (not likely since it doesn't fit the prime factors we need).\n   - For \\(12 = 6 \\times 2\\), \\(x = p_1^5 \\times p_2^1\\) (not likely since it doesn't fit the prime factors we need).\n   - For \\(12 = 4 \\times 3\\), \\(x = p_1^3 \\times p_2^2\\) (not likely since it doesn't fit the prime factors we need).\n   - For \\(12 = 3 \\times 2 \\times 2\\), \\(x = p_1^2 \\times p_2^1 \\times p_3^1\\). This fits the prime factors \\(2^2\\), \\(3\\), and \\(5\\). So, the smallest possible \\(x\\) is \\(2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 60\\). Let's check if 60 has 12 factors:\n   \\[\n   60 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5\n   \\]\n   The number of factors is \\((2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 3 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 12\\).
