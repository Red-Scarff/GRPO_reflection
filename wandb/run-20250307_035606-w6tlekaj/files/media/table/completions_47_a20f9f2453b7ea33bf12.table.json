So, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{20}{2x+1} + \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{5}{x} = \\frac{11}{6}\n\\]\n\nWe need to solve this equation for $x$.\n\nLet's solve this step by step using Python.\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\r\n\r\n# Define the variable\r\nx = symbols('x')\r\n\r\n# Define the equation\r\nequation = Eq(20 / (2 * x + 1) + 1 / 12 + 5 / x, 11 / 6)\r\n\r\n# Solve the equation\r\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\r\nprint(solution)\n```\n```output\n[-0.150268777697538, 8.28212254078863]\n```\nThe solutions to the equation are approximately $-0.1503$ and $8.2821$. Since a negative speed does not make sense in this context, we discard the negative solution.

The vertex of the parabola is at \\((-1, 8)\\). Since the vertex form of a quadratic function \\(f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k\\) has its vertex at \\((h, k)\\), we can write the function as \\(f(x) = a(x + 1)^2 + 8\\).\n2.

We started by isolating \\(u\\) from the first equation:\n   \\[\n   u = \\frac{-7 - 2v}{5}.\n   \\]\n2. We then substituted this expression for \\(u\\) into the second equation:\n   \\[\n   3\\left(\\frac{-7 - 2v}{5}\\right) = 4v - 25.\n   \\]\n3. Simplifying this, we obtained:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{-21 - 6v}{5} = 4v - 25 \\implies -21 - 6v = 20v - 125 \\implies -21 + 125 = 26v \\implies 104 = 26v \\implies v = 4.\n   \\]\n4.

Given the equations 2sin A - sin B = 0 and b + c = \u221a3a, how do we find the value of angle C? Let's analyze the given conditions and solve step by step:\n\n1. From the first condition, 2sin A - sin B = 0, we can deduce that 2sin A = sin B. Using the Law of Sines, which states that a/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C = 2R (where R is the circumradius), we can rewrite the equation as 2a = b. This means that side b is twice as long as side a.\n\n2. From the second condition, b + c = \u221a3a, we substitute the value of b from the first condition to get 2a + c = \u221a3a. Simplifying this, we find that c = (\u221a3 - 2)a. This means that side c is (\u221a3 - 2) times as long as side a.\n\n3. To find angle C, we can use the Law of Cosines:\n   \\[CosC = \\frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab}\\]\n   Substituting the values of b and c in terms of a, we get:\n   \\[CosC = \\frac{a^2 + (2a)^2 - ((\u221a3 - 2)a)^2}{2 \\cdot a \\cdot 2a}\\]\n   Simplifying this expression, we find that:\n   \\[CosC = \\frac{1}{2}\\]\n   This implies that angle C is 60 degrees, as the cosine of 60 degrees is 1/2.\n\nCould you explain what threshold graphs and pyramid graphs are, and how they are related to Fibonacci and Lucas numbers?\nCertainly! A threshold graph is a graph that can be constructed from a single vertex by repeatedly adding an isolated vertex or a dominating vertex (a vertex connected to all existing vertices). These graphs have a simple structure and are characterized by their adjacency matrix being a threshold matrix.\n\nA pyramid graph is a specific type of threshold graph with a particular structure. When you assign weights to the vertices of a pyramid graph and compute the sum of weights on all paths between two fixed vertices, you find that this sum can be expressed in terms of Fibonacci numbers in one scenario, and in terms of Lucas numbers in another.\n\nThe relationship to Fibonacci and Lucas numbers arises from the recursive nature of these sequences and how they can be used to count or weight the paths in the graph. Specifically, the sum of weights on paths in a pyramid graph can be seen as a combinatorial problem that mirrors the recursive definitions of Fibonacci and Lucas numbers.
