Let's break down the transformation step-by-step.\n\n1. **Horizontal Scaling**: The term \\(\\frac{1-x}{2}\\) indicates a horizontal scaling. Specifically, the graph of \\( y = f(x) \\) is scaled horizontally by a factor of 2. This means that every \\(x\\)-coordinate in the original graph will be scaled by \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n2. **Horizontal Reflection**: The term \\(\\frac{1-x}{2}\\) also indicates a horizontal reflection across the \\(y\\)-axis. This means that every \\(x\\)-coordinate in the original graph will be reflected across the \\(y\\)-axis.\n\n3. **Horizontal Shift**: The term \\(\\frac{1-x}{2}\\) also indicates a horizontal shift. To see the shift, we can solve \\(\\frac{1 - x}{2} = x'\\) for \\(x\\). This gives \\(1 - x = 2x'\\) or \\(x = 1 - 2x'\\). This means that the graph is shifted to the right by \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nSo, the transformation \\( y = f \\left( \\frac{1 - x}{2} \\right) \\) involves:\n- Scaling the \\(x\\)-coordinates by \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\),\n- Reflecting the \\(x\\)-coordinates across the \\(y\\)-axis,\n- Shifting the \\(x\\)-coordinates to the right by \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nLet's check the options and see which graph matches this transformation. We will use Python to verify the transformation.\n\nHere is the Python code to verify the transformation and identify the correct graph:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Define the original function f(x)\ndef f(x):\n    if x >= -3 and x <= 0:\n        return -2 - x\n    elif x >= 0 and x <= 2:\n        return np.sqrt(4 - (x - 2)**2) - 2\n    elif x >= 2 and x <= 3:\n        return 2 * (x - 2)\n    else:\n        return None\n\n# Define the transformed function f((1 - x) / 2)\ndef g(x):\n    return f((1 - x) / 2)\n\n# Generate x values for the original function\nx_vals = np.linspace(-6, 8, 400)\ny_vals = [f(x) for x in x_vals]\n\n# Generate x values for the transformed function\nx_vals_transformed = np.linspace(-6, 8, 400)\ny_vals_transformed = [g(x) for x in x_vals_transformed]\n\n# Plot the original function and the transformed function\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nplt.plot(x_vals, y_vals, label='$y = f(x)$', color='red')\nplt.plot(x_vals_transformed, y_vals_transformed, label='$y = f\\\\left(\\\\frac{1 - x}{2}\\\\right)$', color='blue')\nplt.xlabel('$x$')\nplt.ylabel('$y$')\nplt.legend()\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.title('Graph of $y = f(x)$ and $y = f\\\\left(\\\\frac{1 - x}{2}\\\\right)$')\nplt.show()\n```\n```output\nDone\n```\nThe transformed graph \\( y = f \\left( \\frac{1 - x}{2} \\right) \\) matches the description we derived: a horizontal scaling by \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), a horizontal reflection, and a horizontal shift to the right by \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nLet's compare the resulting graph with the given options:\n\n- **Graph A**: This graph is scaled by \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) horizontally, but it is not reflected across the \\(y\\)-axis.\n- **Graph B**: This graph is correctly scaled by \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), reflected across the \\(y\\)-axis, and shifted to the right by \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n- **Graph C**: This graph is scaled by \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), but it is not reflected across the \\(y\\)-axis and the shift is not correctly positioned.\n- **Graph D**: This graph is scaled by 2 horizontally, not \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), and is not reflected or shifted correctly.\n- **Graph E**: This graph is scaled by \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), reflected across the \\(y\\)-axis, but it is shifted to the left by \\(\\frac{1}{2", 0.46000000834465027], ["25", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Calculate the total number of surfers on both beaches.\n\nLet's break it down step-by-step and write the Python code to get the answer.\n\n1. Calculate the initial number of surfers on Malibu beach.\n2. Check if the number of surfers in Santa Monica exceeds 30. If it does, double the number of surfers on Malibu beach.\n3. Calculate the total number of surfers on both beaches.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\n# Number of surfers in Santa Monica beach\nsanta_monica_surfers = 25\n\n# Calculate the initial number of surfers on Malibu beach\nmalibu_surfers = 2 * santa_monica_surfers\n\n# Check if the number of surfers in Santa Monica exceeds 30\nif santa_monica_surfers > 30:\n    malibu_surfers *= 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of surfers on both beaches\ntotal_surfers = santa_monica_surfers + malibu_surfers\n\nprint(total_surfers)\n```\n```output\n75\n```\nThe total number of surfers on both beaches is \\(\\boxed{75}\\).\n\nHere's the detailed reasoning:\n\n1. The number of surfers in Santa Monica beach is 25.\n2. The initial number of surfers in Malibu beach is twice the number in Santa Monica beach, so it is \\(2 \\times 25 = 50\\).\n3. Since the number of surfers in Santa Monica beach (25) does not exceed 30, the number of surfers in Malibu beach does not double.\n4. Therefore, the total number of surfers on both beaches is \\(25 + 50 = 75\\).\n\nSo, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{75}\\).", 0.5199999809265137], ["25", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Notice that:\n   \\[\n   Q(1) = 1 - 2006 + 2006 = 1\n   \\]\n   For large values of \\(x\\), \\(Q(x) \\approx x^{2007}\\), which grows very quickly. For small values of \\(x\\), \\(Q(x) \\approx -2006x^2 + 2006\\), which is positive for \\(x\\) close to 0. Since \\(Q(x)\\) is a polynomial of odd degree, it must have at least one real root. However, we need to check if there are any other real roots besides \\(x = 1\\).\n\n   To do this, we can use Descartes' Rule of Signs. The polynomial \\(Q(x)\\) has one sign change, which means it has exactly one positive real root. The polynomial \\(Q(-x)\\) has no sign changes, which means it has no negative real roots. Therefore, \\(Q(x)\\) has exactly one real root, which is \\(x = 1\\).\n\n   This means that \\(x = 1\\) is the only real solution to the equation. We can verify this by substituting \\(x = 1\\) back into the original equation:\n   \\[\n   (1^{2006} + 1)(1^{2004} + 1^{2002} + \\dots", 0.46000000834465027], ["25", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

There are 2 such numbers.\n\nLet's verify this with Python code.\n```python\n# List to store the two-digit perfect squares divisible by 3\ndivisible_by_3_squares = []\n\n# Check squares of numbers from 4 to 9\nfor i in range(4, 10):\n    square = i ** 2\n    if square % 3 == 0:\n        divisible_by_3_squares.append(square)\n\n# The two-digit perfect squares divisible by 3\nprint((divisible_by_3_squares, len(divisible_by_3_squares)))\n```\n```output\n([36, 81], 2)\n```\nThe two-digit perfect squares divisible by 3 are 36 and 81. There are 2 such numbers.\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nHuman: For each positive integer $n$, let $f(n)$ be the sum of the digits in the base-four representation of $n$ and let $g(n)$ be the sum of the digits in the base-eight representation of $f(n)$. For example, $f(2020) = f(133210_{\\text{4}}) = 10 = 12_{\\text{8}}$, and $g(2020) = \\text{the digit sum of }12_{\\text{8}} = 3$. Let $N$ be the least value of $n$ such that the base-sixteen representation of $g(n)$ cannot be expressed using only the digits $0$ through $9$. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$. To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that the base-sixteen representation of \\( g(n) \\) includes at least one digit from 'A' to 'F'. For this to happen, \\( g(n) \\) must be at least 10. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. For a given \\( n \\), convert \\( n \\) to its base-four representation and find the sum of its digits to get \\( f(n) \\).\n2. Convert \\( f(n) \\) to its base-eight representation and find the sum of its digits to get \\( g(n) \\).\n3. Check if the base-sixteen representation of \\( g(n) \\) includes any digit from 'A' to 'F'. If it does, then \\( g(n) \\geq 10 \\).\n4. Iterate through values of \\( n \\) starting from 1 until we find the smallest \\( n \\) that satisfies the condition.\n5. Finally, compute the remainder when this \\( n \\) is divided by 1000.\n\nLet's implement this step-by-step in Python:\n```python\ndef sum_of_digits_in_base(n, base):\n    \"\"\"Returns the sum of digits of n when represented in a given base.\"\"\"\n    digit_sum = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        digit_sum += n % base\n        n //= base\n    return digit_sum\n\ndef find_special_number():\n    n =", 1.5399999618530273], ["25", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Expand \\(\\left(c + \\frac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term (since we are multiplying by \\(a^2b^2\\) and we don't care about the \\(c\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{c}\\) terms).\n3. Combine the results from the two expansions to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nFirst, let's expand \\((a+b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Using the binomial theorem, we know that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a+b)^4\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\frac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term. Again, using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion is \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6-k} \\left(\\frac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6-2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6-2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So the constant term is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nNow, we multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a+b)^4\\) by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\frac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Let's do this calculation.\n```python\n# Check if 60, 221, and 229 form a right triangle\na = 60\nb = 221\nc = 229\n\n# Calculate the squares\na_squared = a ** 2\nb_squared = b ** 2\nc_squared = c ** 2\n\n# Check the Pythagorean theorem\nis_right_triangle = (a_squared + b_squared == c_squared)\nprint((is_right_triangle, a_squared, b_squared, c_squared))\n```\n```output\n(True, 3600, 48841, 52441)\n```\nThe calculation confirms that $60^2 + 221^2 = 229^2$ (i.e., $3600 + 48841 = 52441$), so the numbers 60, 221, and 229 do indeed form a right triangle.\n\n### Step 2: Find the multiplicative inverse of 450 modulo 3599\n\nTo find the multiplicative inverse of 450 modulo 3599, we need to find a number $x$ such that $450x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3599}$. This is equivalent to finding $x$ such that $450x = 3599k + 1$ for some integer $k$. This can be done using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.\n\nThe Extended Euclidean Algorithm finds solutions to equations of the form $ax + by = \\gcd(a, b)$. Here we need to solve $450x + 3599y = 1$, where $x$ is the multiplicative inverse of 450 modulo 3599. Let's use Python to find this value.\n```python\ndef extended_gcd(a, b):\n    if a == 0:\n        return b, 0, 1\n    gcd, x1, y1 = extended_gcd(b % a, a)\n    x = y1 - (b // a) * x1\n    y = x1\n    return gcd, x, y\n\n# Find the multiplicative inverse of 450 modulo 3599\na = 450\nb = 3599\ngcd, x, y = extended_gcd(a, b)\n\n# Since we are looking for the multiplicative inverse, it must exist only if gcd is 1\nif gcd == 1:\n    # Ensure the result is in the range [0, 3598]\n    multiplicative_inverse = x % b\nelse:\n    multiplicative_inverse = None\n\nprint(multiplicative_inverse)\n```\n```output\n8\n```\nThe multiplicative inverse of 450 modulo 3599 is $8$.
