The reflected ray then passes through point \\(C = (3, 5, 9)\\).\n   - We need to find the point \\(B = (x, y, z)\\) on the plane where the reflection occurs.\n\n2. **Reflection Property:**\n   - The angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. If we consider the normal vector to the plane \\(\\mathbf{n} = (1, 1, 1)\\), then the reflection point \\(B\\) can be found by ensuring that the vector from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) and the vector from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\) make equal angles with the normal vector.\n\n3. **Mathematical Formulation:**\n   - Let \\(B = (x, y, z)\\) be the reflection point on the plane. Since \\(B\\) lies on the plane, \\(x + y + z = 12\\).\n   - The vector from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) is \\(\\mathbf{AB} = (x + 3, y - 9, z - 11)\\).\n   - The vector from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\) is \\(\\mathbf{BC} = (3 - x, 5 - y, 9 - z)\\).\n   - The normal vector to the plane is \\(\\mathbf{n} = (1, 1, 1)\\).\n   - Using the reflection property, the dot product of \\(\\mathbf{AB}\\) with \\(\\mathbf{n}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{BC}\\) with \\(\\mathbf{n}\\) must satisfy a certain condition.\n\n4. **Using SymPy to Solve:**\n   - We can set up the equations and solve them using SymPy.\n\nLet's write the Python code to solve this:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y, z = sp.symbols('x y z')\n\n# Define the plane equation\nplane_eq = x + y + z - 12\n\n# Define the vectors AB and BC\nAB = sp.Matrix([x + 3, y - 9, z - 11])\nBC = sp.Matrix([3 - x, 5 - y, 9 - z])\n\n# Define the normal vector to the plane\nn = sp.Matrix([1, 1, 1])\n\n# Using the reflection property, the dot product condition\n# dot(AB, n) = -dot(BC, n)\ndot_AB_n = AB.dot(n)\ndot_BC_n = BC.dot(n)\nreflection_eq = sp.Eq(dot_AB_n, -dot_BC_n)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = sp.solve((plane_eq, reflection_eq), (x, y, z))\nprint(solution)\n```\n```output\n{x: -z/2 - 1, y: 13 - z/2}\n```\nThe output indicates that the solution is in terms of \\(z\\). This means that there is a relationship between \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\), but we need to find specific values for \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) that satisfy both the plane equation and the reflection property.\n\nGiven that \\(x = -\\frac{z}{2} - 1\\) and \\(y = 13 - \\frac{z}{2}\\), we can substitute these into the plane equation \\(x + y + z = 12\\) to find the value of \\(z\\):\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{z}{2} - 1 + 13 - \\frac{z}{2} + z = 12\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this equation:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{z}{2} - \\frac{z}{2} + z - 1 + 13 = 12 \\implies 0 + 12 = 12 \\implies 12 = 12\n\\]\n\nThis means that the value of \\(z\\) can be any value that satisfies the relationship. However, since we are dealing with a geometric problem and the reflection point should be unique, we can find a specific value for \\(z\\) by considering the nature of the problem.\n\nLet's substitute \\(z = 6\\) (a simple and logical choice) into the equations for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\):\n\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{6}{2} - 1 = -3\n\\]\n\\[\ny = 13 - \\frac{6}{2} = 10\n\\]\n\nSo the point \\(B\\) is \\((-3", 0.30000001192092896], ["50", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

At that time, her father's age is four times Marika's age. So, if \\( F \\) is her father's age in 2004:\n\\[ F = 4 \\times 8 = 32 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the equation for future years\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of years after 2004 when Marika's father says, \"My age is now three times your age.\" At that time, Marika's age will be \\( 8 + x \\) and her father's age will be \\( 32 + x \\). So, the equation will be:\n\\[ 32 + x = 3 \\times (8 + x) \\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve the equation\n\nLet's solve the equation step by step:\n\\[ 32 + x = 24 + 3x \\]\n\\[ 32 - 24 = 3x - x \\]\n\\[ 8 = 2x \\]\n\\[ x = 4 \\]\n\nSo, this event will happen 4 years after 2004.

Simplifying this, we get:\n\n\\[\n4h - 3k - 30 = -4h + 3k - 10\n\\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n\\[\n8h - 6k = 20 \\implies 4h - 3k = 10\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve the System of Equations\n\nWe now have two equations:\n\n1. \\(2h + k = 0\\) (since the center \\((h, k)\\) lies on the line \\(2x + y = 0\\))\n2. \\(4h - 3k = 10\\)\n\nLet's solve this system of equations using SymPy:\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variables\nh, k = sp.symbols('h k')\n\n# Define the equations\neq1 = 2*h + k\neq2 = 4*h - 3*k - 10\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = sp.solve((eq1, eq2), (h, k))\nprint(solution)\n```\n```output\n{h: 2, k: -4}\n```\nThe solution to the system of equations is \\(h = 2\\) and \\(k = -4\\).

We are asked to find the total area of the four triangular faces of a right, square-based pyramid with a base edge length of 6 units and a lateral edge length of 5 units.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry\n- The base is a square with side length 6 units.\n- Each of the four triangular faces has a base of 6 units and a slant height (the length from the midpoint of the base to the vertex of the pyramid) that we need to determine.\n\n### Step 2: Finding the Slant Height\nThe slant height can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. Consider a right triangle formed by the height of the pyramid, half the length of the base, and the slant height. The height of the pyramid can be found by considering a right triangle formed by half the diagonal of the base and the height of the pyramid, and the slant height of one of the triangular faces.\n\n1. The diagonal of the base square is \\(6\\sqrt{2}\\) units.\n2. Half the diagonal is \\(3\\sqrt{2}\\) units.\n3. The height of the pyramid \\(h\\) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle with the lateral edge (5 units), half the diagonal of the base (3 units), and the height \\(h\\) of the pyramid:\n   \\[\n   5^2 = \\left(3\\sqrt{2}\\right)^2 + h^2 \\implies 25 = 18 + h^2 \\implies h^2 = 7 \\implies h = \\sqrt{7}\n   \\]\n4.
