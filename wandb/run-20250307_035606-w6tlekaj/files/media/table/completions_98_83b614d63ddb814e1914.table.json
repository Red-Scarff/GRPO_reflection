The key here is to notice the pattern in the last two digits of powers of 9.\n\n### Step 2: Find the pattern in the last two digits\nLet's calculate the last two digits of the first few powers of 9:\n- \\(9^1 = 09\\)\n- \\(9^2 = 81\\)\n- \\(9^3 = 29\\) (since \\(81 \\times 9 = 729\\), and the last two digits are 29)\n- \\(9^4 = 61\\) (since \\(29 \\times 9 = 261\\), and the last two digits are 61)\n- \\(9^5 = 49\\) (since \\(61 \\times 9 = 549\\), and the last two digits are 49)\n- \\(9^6 = 41\\) (since \\(49 \\times 9 = 441\\), and the last two digits are 41)\n- \\(9^7 = 69\\) (since \\(41 \\times 9 = 369\\), and the last two digits are 69)\n- \\(9^8 = 21\\) (since \\(69 \\times 9 = 621\\), and the last two digits are 21)\n- \\(9^9 = 89\\) (since \\(21 \\times 9 = 189\\), and the last two digits are 89)\n- \\(9^{10} = 01\\) (since \\(89 \\times 9 = 801\\), and the last two digits are 01)\n\nFrom this, we can see that the last two digits of \\(9^{10}\\) are 01. This indicates that the powers of 9 repeat every 10 cycles. Therefore, to find the last two digits of \\(9^{2004}\\), we need to find the remainder when 2004 is divided by 10. The remainder when 2004 is divided by 10 is 4. So, the last two digits of \\(9^{2004}\\) will be the same as the last two digits of \\(9^4\\), which are 61. \n\n### Step 3: Sum the tens and units digits\nThe tens digit is 6 and the units digit is 1.

Since a square has four equal sides, each side of the square is $48 / 4 = 12$ inches.\n\nWhen we cut out an equilateral triangle $BFC$ from the square and translate it to the left of the square, we create a new shape $ABFCDE$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the New Shape $ABFCDE$\n\nThe original square had four sides, each 12 inches. When we cut out the equilateral triangle $BFC$, we remove one side of the triangle, which is also 12 inches. However, we add two new sides when we translate the triangle to the left. These two sides are also 12 inches each because the triangle is equilateral.\n\nSo, we start with four sides of 12 inches each from the original square, and then we subtract one side of 12 inches and add two sides of 12 inches each from the translated triangle.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Perimeter of $ABFCDE$\n\nThe original perimeter of the square is 48 inches. We subtract one side of 12 inches and add two sides of 12 inches each. This gives us a new perimeter:\n\n\\[ \\text{New Perimeter} = 48 - 12 + 12 + 12 = 60 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nNow, let's verify this step-by-step with Python code to ensure accuracy.\n```python\n# Given data\r\noriginal_square_perimeter = 48\r\nside_length = original_square_perimeter / 4\r\n\r\n# Original perimeter calculation\r\noriginal_perimeter = 4 * side_length\r\n\r\n# New perimeter after removing one side and adding two sides of the equilateral triangle\r\nnew_perimeter = original_perimeter - side_length + 2 * side_length\r\n\r\n# Display the final result\r\nprint(new_perimeter)\n```\n```output\n60.0\n```\nThe perimeter of the new shape $ABFCDE$ is \\(\\boxed{60}\\) inches.\n\nA high-end boutique store is running a special sale where the discount on the items is calculated based on the total purchase amount.

Then, find the total purchase amount after applying the discount for a customer who purchased items worth $1500. To solve this problem, we need to define a piecewise function \\(D(x)\\) that calculates the discount based on the total purchase amount \\(x\\). The function will be defined as follows:\n\n\\[ D(x) = \\begin{cases} \n0 & \\text{if } x \\leq 500 \\\\\n0.1(x - 500) & \\text{if } 501 \\leq x \\leq 1000 \\\\\n0.2(x - 1000) + 50 & \\text{if } 1001 \\leq x \\leq 2000 \\\\\n0.3(x - 2000) + 150 & \\text{if } x > 2000 \n\\end{cases} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the total purchase amount after applying the discount for a customer who purchased items worth $1500.

The distance traveled in the first second is 28 feet.\n2. The distance traveled in the second second is 28 - 7 = 21 feet.\n3. The distance traveled in the third second is 21 - 7 = 14 feet.\n4. We can see that the distance traveled each second forms an arithmetic sequence where the first term \\(a_1 = 28\\) and the common difference \\(d = -7\\).\n5. The car stops when the distance traveled in a particular second is 0 or less.\n6. We need to find the number of terms in the sequence before the distance traveled is less than or equal to 0. The \\(n\\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:\n   \\[\n   a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\n   \\]\n   Setting \\(a_n = 0\\) and solving for \\(n\\):\n   \\[\n   28 + (n-1)(-7) = 0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   28 - 7(n-1) = 0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   28 = 7(n-1)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   n-1 = 4\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   n = 5\n   \\]\n7. The car stops after 5 seconds. We now need to find the total distance traveled in these 5 seconds. The sum of the first \\(n\\) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:\n   \\[\n   S_n = \\frac{n}{2} (2a_1 + (n-1)d)\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   S_5 = \\frac{5}{2} (2 \\cdot 28 + (5-1)(-7))\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   S_5 = \\frac{5}{2} (56 + 4(-7))\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   S_5 = \\frac{5}{2} (56 - 28)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   S_5 = \\frac{5}{2} \\cdot 28\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   S_5 = 5 \\cdot 14 = 70\n   \\]\n\nSo, the total distance traveled by the car from the time the brakes are applied to the time the car stops is 70 feet.

These spellbooks can be borrowed by the library members in any order, but due to a magical rule, after borrowing a spellbook, it has to be returned before another can be picked up. Additionally, no spellbook can be borrowed more than once in a single borrowing session. If a member starts borrowing spellbooks without returning any, how many distinct sequences of borrowing all four spellbooks can occur? Remember, once a spellbook is returned, it cannot be borrowed again until all others have been returned and borrowed once. To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct sequences in which a member can borrow all four spellbooks without returning any until all have been borrowed. This is equivalent to finding the number of permutations of the four spellbooks.\n\nSince there are 4 unique spellbooks, the number of distinct sequences is given by the number of permutations of 4 distinct items, which is \\(4!\\) (4 factorial).\n\nThe factorial of a number \\(n\\), denoted \\(n!\\), is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to \\(n\\).
