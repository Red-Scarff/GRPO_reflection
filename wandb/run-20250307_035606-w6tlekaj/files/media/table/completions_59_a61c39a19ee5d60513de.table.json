Since $\\sin(x)$ can only take values between -1 and 1, the only way for $\\sin((n^2+n)a)$ to be an integer is if it is either -1, 0, or 1. This means that $(n^2+n)a$ must be an integer multiple of $\\pi/2$ (since $\\sin(k\\pi/2) \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ for any integer $k$).\n\nGiven that $a = \\pi/2008$, we need:\n\\[(n^2+n) \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{2008} = k \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{2},\\]\nfor some integer $k$. This simplifies to:\n\\[\\frac{n^2+n}{2008} = \\frac{k}{2} \\implies n^2 + n = 1004k.\\]\n\nWe need to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $n^2 + n$ is a multiple of 1004. We can factorize 1004 as $1004 = 2^2 \\cdot 251$. So $n^2 + n = n(n+1)$ must be divisible by $1004 = 2^2 \\cdot 251$. Since $n$ and $n+1$ are consecutive integers, one of them must be divisible by 251, and at least one of them must be divisible by 4. The smallest such $n$ is 251, because 251 is a prime number and thus the smallest number that is divisible by 251.\n\nLet's verify this:\n\\[n = 251 \\implies n^2 + n = 251^2 + 251 = 251 \\cdot 252 = 251 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 126) = 2^2 \\cdot 251 \\cdot 126,\\]\nwhich is indeed divisible by $1004 = 2^2 \\cdot 251$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ is $251$. We can wrap this up in the required format.\n```python\n# Verification code to ensure that n = 251 satisfies the condition\nn = 251\n# Calculate n^2 + n\nexpression_value = n**2 + n\n# Check if the expression_value is divisible by 1004\nis_divisible = expression_value", 0.47999998927116394], ["30", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.
