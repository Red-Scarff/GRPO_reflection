A grasshopper can jump from chair $k$ to chair $n$ if $k-n$ is one of the four numbers $-8, -5, 5, 8$. It is known that it has visited each chair exactly once. What are the possible initial positions?\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the possible starting positions (initial positions) for the grasshopper such that it can visit each chair exactly once by jumping according to the given rules. This problem can be approached as a graph traversal problem where each chair is a node and there is an edge between two nodes if the difference between their numbers is one of the four numbers \\(-8, -5, 5, 8\\).\n\nWe can use a backtracking approach to find all possible paths that visit each chair exactly once. Here's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Represent the chairs as nodes in a graph.\n2. Create edges between nodes based on the allowed jumps.\n3. Use a backtracking algorithm to find all Hamiltonian paths (paths that visit each node exactly once).\n4.

So, we get $a = 1$, $b = 4$, and $c = 10$.

We see that 625 is not one of the options, so we need to check if we missed any constraints or made an error.

Another possible combination is $110 = 2 \\cdot 55$, which suggests $a+1 = 2$, $b+1 = 5$, and $c+1 = 55$, or $a = 1$, $b = 4$, and $c = 54$. This would mean $n$ is of the form $2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot p^{18}$, where $p$ is a prime. But since we need to check the divisors of $81n^4$, and $81 = 3^4$, the form of $n$ should not introduce new primes other than those already in $81$. So, the simplest form is indeed $n = 110$.\n\nLet's calculate the number of divisors of $81n^4$ again with $n = 110$:\n\\[\n81n^4 = 3^4 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11)^4 = 3^4 \\cdot 2^4 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 11^4\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Number of divisors} = (4+1)(4+1)(4+1)(4+1) = 5 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5 = 625\n\\]\n\nSince 625 is not one of the options, we need to check if there's another possible form of $n$.

Identify all other positive integers that are the product of exactly three distinct primes whose sum is equal to the sum of the prime factors of 5002.\n\nLet's start by finding the prime factors of 5002.\n\n### Step 1: Factorize 5002\n\nWe can start by checking for divisibility by the smallest prime number, 2. If 5002 is divisible by 2, we can divide it by 2 and continue the process until we can't divide by 2 anymore.

It's not divisible by 11. We continue with the next prime number, 13. It's not divisible by 13. We continue with the next prime number, 17. It's not divisible by 17. We continue with the next prime number, 19. It's not divisible by 19. We continue with the next prime number, 23. It's not divisible by 23. We continue with the next prime number, 29. It's not divisible by 29. We continue with the next prime number, 31. It's not divisible by 31. We continue with the next prime number, 37. It's not divisible by 37. We continue with the next prime number, 41. It's divisible by 41.\n\n2501 \u00f7 41 = 61\n61 is a prime number.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 5002 is 2 \u00d7 41 \u00d7 61.

These lines can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.\n\n1. **Horizontal and Vertical Lines:** There are 5 horizontal lines and 5 vertical lines, each containing 5 points. The number of ways to choose 3 collinear points from a line of 5 points is $\\binom{5}{3} = 10$. Since there are 10 lines (5 horizontal + 5 vertical), the total number of collinear point sets from horizontal and vertical lines is $10 \\times 10 = 100$.\n\n2. **Diagonal Lines:** We need to count the number of diagonal lines in both directions.\n    - For diagonals with a slope of 1 or -1, there are 5 lines in each direction (one for each possible length from 5 to 1). The number of ways to choose 3 collinear points from a line of length $n$ is $\\binom{n}{3}$. So we need to sum $\\binom{5}{3} + \\binom{4}{3} + \\binom{3}{3} + \\binom{2}{3} + \\binom{1}{3}$ for each direction. Since $\\binom{2}{3} = \\binom{1}{3} = 0$, the sum for one direction is $10 + 4 + 1 = 15$. Therefore, the total for both directions is $15 \\times 2 = 30$.\n\nSo the total number of collinear point sets is $100 + 30 = 130$. Therefore, the number of triangles with positive area is $2300 - 130 = 2170$. However, this answer is not among the choices, so let's verify the collinear points calculation again.\n\nWe need to check for all possible lines, including those with different slopes. Let's write the code to ensure we capture all collinear points correctly.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef is_collinear(p1, p2, p3):\n    (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) = p1, p2, p3\n    return (y2 - y1) * (x3 - x1) == (y3 - y1) * (x2 - x1)\n\npoints = [(i, j) for i in range(1, 6) for j in range(1, 6)]\ncount = 0\n\nfor p1, p2, p3 in combinations(points, 3):\n    if is_collinear(p1, p2, p3):\n        count += 1\n\ntotal_triangles = 2300  # Total number of ways to choose 3 points from 25\nvalid_triangles = total_triangles - count\nprint(valid_triangles)\n```\n```output\n2148\n```\nThe number of triangles with positive area that can be formed with vertices at points $(i, j)$ where $i$ and $j$ are integers between 1 and 5, inclusive, is \\(\\boxed{2148}\\).\n\nFour consecutive positive integers have a product of 840.

The number of ways to choose 3 points out of 5 on each horizontal line is $\\binom{5}{3} = 10$.

There are lines with slopes of 1 or -1 that have 3, 4, or 5 points. There are 2 lines with 5 points (one with a positive slope and one with a negative slope), 4 lines with 4 points (two with a positive slope and two with a negative slope), and 6 lines with 3 points (three with a positive slope and three with a negative slope). The number of ways to choose 3 points out of 5 on each of the 2 lines with 5 points is $\\binom{5}{3} = 10$, so there are $2 \\times 10 = 20$ collinear points on these lines. The number of ways to choose 3 points out of 4 on each of the 4 lines with 4 points is $\\binom{4}{3} = 4$, so there are $4 \\times 4 = 16$ collinear points on these lines. The number of ways to choose 3 points out of 3 on each of the 6 lines with 3 points is $\\binom{3}{3} = 1$, so there are $6 \\times 1 = 6$ collinear points on these lines. The total number of collinear points on diagonal lines is $20 + 16 + 6 = 42$.\n\nAdding the number of collinear points from horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines, we get $50 + 50 + 42 = 142$ collinear points in total.
