What is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $p^2 - k$ is divisible by 12? To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer \\( k \\) such that \\( p^2 - k \\) is divisible by 12, where \\( p \\) is the largest prime with 2010 digits. Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Properties of Primes:**\n   - Any prime number greater than 3 is of the form \\( 6n \\pm 1 \\). This means that \\( p \\equiv \\pm 1 \\pmod{6} \\), or equivalently, \\( p^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{6} \\).\n   - Since \\( p \\) is a prime greater than 3, it is odd. The square of an odd number is always congruent to 1 modulo 8. Therefore, \\( p^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8} \\).\n\n2. **Combining Congruences:**\n   - Since \\( p^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{6} \\) and \\( p^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8} \\), and 6 and 8 are coprime, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to combine these congruences. The solution to these congruences is \\( p^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{24} \\). This means \\( p^2 - 1 \\) is divisible by 24.\n\n3. **Finding \\( k \\):**\n   - We need \\( p^2 - k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12} \\), which simplifies to \\( k \\equiv p^2 \\pmod{12} \\). Since \\( p^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{24} \\), it follows that \\( p^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{12} \\). Therefore, \\( k = 1 \\) is the smallest positive integer that satisfies the condition.\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer \\( k \\) such that \\( p^2 - k \\) is divisible by 12 is \\( \\boxed{1} \\).\n\nLet's confirm this with a small Python code snippet to ensure the logic holds:\n\n```python\n# We know that p^2 \u2261 1 (mod 24), so let's check p^2 mod 12\n# Any prime p > 3 will satisfy this condition\n\n# Let's verify for a general prime p > 3\n# We can take any prime number greater than 3, for example, 5\np = 5\np_squared = p ** 2\nremainder = p_squared % 12\n\n# The smallest positive integer k such that p^2 - k is divisible by", 0.5], ["55", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Without loss of generality, we can assume that the sides $AB = 31$, and the other five sides are $BC = CD = DE = EF = FA = 81$.\n\nTo find the lengths of the diagonals from point $A$, we need to use properties of cyclic hexagons and the fact that the circle circumscribing the hexagon is also the circle circumscribing the chords.

To determine the total number of coins Bobby has, we start by defining the total number of coins as \\( x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem:\n- One half of Bobby's coins are pennies.\n- One fourth of his coins are quarters.\n- Three of his coins are dimes.\n\nWe can express these relationships mathematically:\n- The number of pennies is \\( \\frac{1}{2}x \\).\n- The number of quarters is \\( \\frac{1}{4}x \\).\n- The number of dimes is 3.\n\nSince the total number of coins is the sum of the pennies, quarters, and dimes, we can write the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{1}{4}x + 3 = x\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we first combine the fractions on the left side of the equation. The common denominator for \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) is 4. Therefore, we rewrite the fractions:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}x = \\frac{2}{4}x\n\\]\n\nNow the equation becomes:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{4}x + \\frac{1}{4}x + 3 = x\n\\]\n\nCombine the fractions:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4}x + 3 = x\n\\]\n\nNext, isolate \\( x \\) by subtracting \\(\\frac{3}{4}x\\) from both sides of the equation:\n\\[\n3 = x - \\frac{3}{4}x\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n3 = \\frac{1}{4}x\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), multiply both sides by 4:\n\\[\nx = 3 \\times 4\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 12\n\\]\n\nThus, Bobby has \\(\\boxed{12}\\) coins.\n\nTo verify, we check the number of each type of coin:\n- Pennies: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 = 6 \\)\n- Quarters: \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 12 = 3 \\)\n- Dimes: 3\n\nAdding these together:\n\\[\n6 + 3 + 3 = 12\n\\]\n\nThe calculations confirm that Bobby has \\(\\", 0.47999998927116394], ["55", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

We need to carefully count all the triangles formed by these lines. Let's break this down logically.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.

For our triangle with side length \\( s = 5 \\), the median length is \\( \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\).\n    - The distance from the centroid to any vertex is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\).\n\n3. **Height Calculation**:\n    - The height of the original tripod (4 feet) is the remaining length of the leg from the centroid to the top vertex. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance from the centroid to the base (which we already know is \\( \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\)).\n    - The height \\( h \\) from the centroid to the top vertex is given by \\( \\sqrt{5^2 - \\left(\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{25 - \\frac{25 \\cdot 3}{9}} = \\sqrt{25 - \\frac{75}{9}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225 - 75}{9}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{150}{9}} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{6}}{3} \\).\n    - Since the top of the tripod is 4 feet from the ground, we have \\( 4 = \\frac{5\\sqrt{6}}{3} - 0 \\) (as the original height was \\( \\frac{5\\sqrt{6}}{3} \\)).\n\n4. **Broken Leg Analysis**:\n    - When one leg is broken by 1 foot, the new length of that leg is 4 feet.\n    - The new height \\( h \\) from the centroid to the top vertex will change. We need to recalculate the height using the new leg length.\n    - The new height from the centroid to the top vertex is given by \\( \\sqrt{4^2 - \\left(\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{16 - \\frac{75}{9}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{144 - 75}{9}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{69}{9}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{69}}{3} \\).\n    - Since the height from the ground to the top vertex is the sum of the height from the ground to the centroid and the height from the centroid to the top vertex, we get \\( h = 4 - \\frac{5\\sqrt{6}}{3} + \\frac{\\sqrt{69}}{3} = \\frac{12 - 5\\sqrt{6} + \\sqrt{69}}{3} \\).\n\n5. **Simplification**:\n    - The height \\( h \\) can be written in the form \\(\\frac{m}{\\sqrt{n}}\\).

Given that the tripod forms a tetrahedron with each leg of length 5 feet and the top of the tripod is 4 feet from the ground, we can consider the geometry of this setup.\n\n### Step 2: Use the Law of Cosines\n\nWhen the tripod is set up, the three legs form a tetrahedron with the ground. Let the three legs intersect the ground at points A, B, and C, and the top of the tripod be point D. The height of the tripod forms a right triangle with the centroid of triangle ABC and point D. Since the legs are all equal and the angles between them are equal, the centroid of triangle ABC will be directly below point D and will divide the height into two parts: the height from the centroid to point D and the height from the ground to the centroid.\n\n### Step 3: Set up the equations\n\nGiven that the legs are all 5 feet long, if we consider the centroid of the triangle ABC, it will be located at a distance of $\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{3}}$ feet from each of the vertices of the triangle.

The height from the new centroid to the top of the tripod will change, but we can use similar geometric relationships to find the new height.

To find the height of each leg's intersection point from the ground when the tripod is initially set up, we use the properties of equilateral triangles and the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions.\n\n2. **Symmetry and Geometry**: Because the angles between any pair of legs are equal, the base of the tripod forms an equilateral triangle. The height of the apex from the base can be found by considering the centroid of the equilateral triangle. The centroid divides each median in a 2:1 ratio. The length of each median of the equilateral triangle can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n3. **Broken Leg**: When one leg breaks off by 1 foot, the new leg length is 4 feet.

Let's denote the height of the tripod when all legs are intact as \\(H\\). Since the height from the top of the tripod to the ground is 4 feet, the height from the centroid of the base to the top of the tripod is \\(5 - 4 = 1\\) foot.\n\nThe centroid of the equilateral triangle formed by the base of the tripod is located at \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of the length of the altitude from any vertex of the base.

We need to find the new height \\(h\\) of the top of the tripod from the ground. The new configuration forms a tetrahedron with one leg of length 4 feet and the other two legs of length 5 feet, and the height from the top of the tripod to the ground is \\(h\\).\n\nTo find \\(h\\), we can use the fact that the height from the top of the tripod to the ground is related to the volume of the tetrahedron.

The values of $\\sin x$ and $\\cos x$ are related by the equation $\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1$. If we let $\\sin x = a$ and $\\cos x = b$, then $\\tan x = \\frac{a}{b}$. Since $a$ and $b$ are both between 0 and 1, $\\tan x$ can take any positive value.\n\n3. **Identify Possible Values for Malvina:** Since Malvina can uniquely identify her card, her card must have a value that is not shared by $\\sin x$ and $\\cos x$.

Check which values, when shared with the other two values, allow only one interpretation.\n\nFor an acute angle \\(x\\):\n- If Malvina has \\(\\tan x\\), the value must be unique given the values of \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(\\cos x\\).\n- If Malvina has \\(\\sin x\\), the value must not allow both \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(\\cos x\\) to be switched, and similarly for \\(\\cos x\\).\n\nLet's write the Python code to check these conditions and find the possible values on Malvina's card.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variables\nx = sp.symbols('x')\nsin_x = sp.sin(x)\ncos_x = sp.cos(x)\ntan_x = sp.tan(x)\n\n# Define the range for x in radians (0 to pi/2)\nx_values = sp.linspace(0, sp.pi/2, 1000)[1:-1]  # avoid endpoints\n\npossible_values = set()\n\n# Check for each value of x\nfor x_val in x_values:\n    sin_val = sin_x.subs(x, x_val)\n    cos_val = cos_x.subs(x, x_val)\n    tan_val = tan_x.subs(x, x_val)\n    # Check if the value can uniquely identify the function\n    if (sin_val != cos_val) and (sin_val != tan_val) and (cos_val != tan_val):\n        possible_values.add(sin_val)\n        possible_values.add(cos_val)\n        possible_values.add(tan_val)\n\n# Sum of all possible values on Malvina's card\nsum_possible_values = sum(possible_values.evalf() for possible_values in possible_values)\nprint(sum_possible_values)\n```\n```output\nAttributeError: module 'sympy' has no attribute 'linspace'\n```\nIt seems there's an issue with using `linspace` from the `sympy` module. Instead, we can use NumPy for generating a set of values within the specified range. Let's correct the code and try again.\n\nHere's the revised code using NumPy to generate the values:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the variables\nx = sp.symbols('x')\nsin_x = sp.sin(x)\ncos_x = sp.cos(x)\ntan_x = sp.tan(x)\n\n# Define the range for x in radians (0 to pi/2)\nx_values = np.linspace(0, np.pi/2, 1000)[1:-1]  # avoid endpoints\n\npossible_values = set()\n\n# Check for each value of x\nfor x_val in x_values:\n    sin_val = sin_x.subs(x, x_val)\n    cos_val = cos_x.subs(x, x_val)\n    tan_val = tan_x.subs(x, x_val)\n    # Check if the value can uniquely identify the function\n    if (sin_val != cos_val) and (sin_val != tan_val) and (cos_val != tan_val):\n        possible_values.add(sin_val)\n        possible_values.add(cos_val)\n        possible_values.add(tan_val)\n\n", 0.5099999904632568], ["55", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.
