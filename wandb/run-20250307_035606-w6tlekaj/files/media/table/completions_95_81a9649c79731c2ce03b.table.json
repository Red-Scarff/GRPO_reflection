The decimal number obtained by writing \\( a \\) before the decimal point and \\( b \\) after the decimal point is \\( a + \\frac{b}{100} \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, these two values are equal:\n\\[ \\frac{a + b}{2} = a + \\frac{b}{100}. \\]\n\nTo solve this equation, let's first clear the fraction by multiplying both sides by 200:\n\\[ 100(a + b) = 200a + 2b. \\]\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\\[ 100a + 100b = 200a + 2b, \\]\n\\[ 100b - 2b = 200a - 100a, \\]\n\\[ 98b = 100a, \\]\n\\[ 49b = 50a. \\]\n\nThis equation tells us that \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) must be multiples of 49 and 50 respectively. Since \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are both 2-digit integers, the only solution is \\( a = 49 \\cdot 1 = 49 \\) and \\( b = 50 \\cdot 1 = 50 \\).\n\nSo the smaller of the two integers is \\( 49 \\). Let's confirm this by checking the average and the decimal number:\n\nThe average of 49 and 50 is \\( \\frac{49 + 50}{2} = 49.5 \\).\nThe decimal number obtained by writing 49 before the decimal point and 50 after the decimal point is \\( 49.50 \\).\n\nThese two values are equal, confirming that our solution is correct.

We need to find the area of the rhombus.\n\n### Key Properties and Formulas\n1. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Let's denote the diagonals as \\(AC = d_1\\) and \\(BD = d_2\\). The side length of the rhombus is \\(a\\).\n2. The formula for the circumradius \\(R\\) of a triangle with sides \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   R = \\frac{abc}{4K}\n   \\]\n   where \\(K\\) is the area of the triangle.\n3. For triangle \\(ABD\\), the circumradius is \\(12.5\\). Since \\(AB = AD = a\\) and \\(BD = d_2\\), and the area \\(K\\) of triangle \\(ABD\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot d_1 \\cdot \\frac{d_2}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} d_1 d_2\\), we can write:\n   \\[\n   12.5 = \\frac{a \\cdot a \\cdot d_2}{4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} d_1 d_2} = \\frac{a^2}{d_1}\n   \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   d_1 = \\frac{a^2}{50}\n   \\]\n4. Similarly, for triangle \\(ACD\\), the circumradius is \\(25\\). Since \\(AC = d_1\\) and \\(CD = AD = a\\) and the area \\(K\\) of triangle \\(ACD\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot d_1 \\cdot \\frac{d_2}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} d_1 d_2\\), we can write:\n   \\[\n   25 = \\frac{a \\cdot a \\cdot d_2}{4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} d_1 d_2} = \\frac{a^2}{d_1}\n   \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   d_1 = \\frac{a^2}{100}\n   \\]\n5. Since we have two different expressions for \\(d_1\\), we can equate them:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{a^2}{50} = \\frac{a^2}{100}\n   \\]\n   This implies that the side length \\(a\\) must be such that the expressions are consistent. We can solve this step by step using SymPy.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution with Python and SymPy\nLet's implement this in Python to find the side length \\(a\\) and then calculate the area of the rhombus.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variables\na, d1, d2 = sp.symbols('a d1 d2')\n\n# Equations from the circumradius formulas\neq1 = sp.Eq(d1, a**2 / 50)\neq2 = sp.Eq(d1, a**2 / 100)\n\n# Solve the equations\nsolution = sp.solve([eq1, eq2], (d1, a))\na_val = solution[a]\n\n# Calculate the area of the rhombus\narea = (1/2) * d1 * d2\nd1_val = a_val**2 / 50\nd2_val = 2 * a_val**2 / 25\narea_val = area.subs({d1: d1_val, d2: d2_val})\n\nprint(area_val)\n```\n```output\nTypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not Symbol\n```\nIt seems there was an error in the code due to how the solution was handled. Let's correct the approach by solving the equations step by step and ensuring we correctly substitute the values.\n\n### Corrected Approach\n1. We know that the expressions for \\(d_1\\) from both circumradius formulas must be consistent. Therefore, we can solve for \\(a\\) directly.\n2. Once we have \\(a\\), we can find \\(d_1\\) and \\(d_2\\).\n3. Finally, we can calculate the area of the rhombus.\n\nLet's update the code accordingly:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variables\na = sp.symbols('a')\n\n# Equations from the circumradius formulas\nd1 = a", 0.5], ["50", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Substituting the expressions in base 10:\n  \\[\n  (2a^2 + 9a + 3) + (4a^2 + 6a + 8) = 7a^2 + 3a + 11\n  \\]\n\n### Step 4: Solve for \\(a\\)\n\nLet's combine and simplify the equation:\n\n\\[\n2a^2 + 9a + 3 + 4a^2 + 6a + 8 = 7a^2 + 3a + 11\n\\]\n\n\\[\n6a^2 + 15a + 11 = 7a^2 + 3a + 11\n\\]\n\nSimplify further:\n\n\\[\n6a^2 + 15a + 11 - 7a^2 - 3a - 11 = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n-a^2 + 12a = 0\n\\]\n\nFactor out \\(a\\):\n\n\\[\na(-a + 12) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us two solutions:\n\n\\[\na = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad a = 12\n\\]\n\nSince \\(a\\) must be a valid base (greater than or equal to 2), the solution is \\(a = 12\\).\n\nLet's verify this solution using Python to ensure accuracy.\n```python\n# Define the equation components as functions\ndef lhs_base_a(a):\n    return (2 * a**2 + 9 * a + 3) + (4 * a**2 + 6 * a + 8)\n\ndef rhs_base_a(a):\n    return 7 * a**2 + 3 * a + 11\n\n# Check the solution\na = 12\nlhs_result = lhs_base_a(a)\nrhs_result = rhs_base_a(a)\n\nprint((lhs_result == rhs_result, lhs_result, rhs_result))\n```\n```output\n(True, 1331, 1331)\n```\nThe verification shows that when \\(a = 12\\), both sides of the equation are equal:\n\n\\[\n\\text{LHS} = \\text{RHS} = 1331\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that the solution \\(a = 12\\) is correct.\n\nThus, the value of \\(a\\) that satisfies the given equation is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).\n\nMr. Smith takes his wife, his parents, his 3 children, and his brother to a seafood buffet.

First, we need to understand the problem in terms of base \\(a\\). The numbers \\(293_a\\), \\(468_a\\), and \\(73B_a\\) are expressed in base \\(a\\). Here, \\(B_a = 11_{10}\\), meaning in base \\(a\\), the digit \\(B\\) represents the decimal value 11.\n\n2. Convert each number from base \\(a\\) to base 10. For example, the number \\(293_a\\) in base \\(a\\) can be written in base 10 as:\n   \\[\n   2a^2 + 9a + 3\n   \\]\n   Similarly, \\(468_a\\) in base 10 is:\n   \\[\n   4a^2 + 6a + 8\n   \\]\n   And \\(73B_a\\) in base 10 is:\n   \\[\n   7a^2 + 3a + 11\n   \\]\n\n3. According to the problem, the sum of \\(293_a\\) and \\(468_a\\) in base \\(a\\) should equal \\(73B_a\\) in base \\(a\\).

Subtract \\(7a^2 + 3a + 11\\) from both sides to solve for \\(a\\):\n   \\[\n   6a^2 + 15a + 11 - 7a^2 - 3a - 11 = 0\n   \\]\n   Simplifying further, we get:\n   \\[\n   -a^2 + 12a = 0\n   \\]\n   Factoring out \\(a\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   a(-a + 12) = 0\n   \\]\n\n6. This gives us two solutions: \\(a = 0\\) or \\(a = 12\\).
