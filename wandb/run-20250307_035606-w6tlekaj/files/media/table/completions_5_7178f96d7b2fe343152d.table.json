It is known that a certain workshop produced 250 products that day. The number of products selected from this workshop is \u25b2.\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the stratified sampling method. The idea behind stratified sampling is to ensure that the sample accurately represents the proportion of each workshop in the total production. The number of products selected from a particular workshop should be proportional to the number of products that workshop produced relative to the total number of products produced.\n\nGiven:\n- Total number of products produced = 2000\n- Total sample size = 200\n- Number of products produced by the workshop = 250\n\nThe proportion of products produced by the workshop is $\\frac{250}{2000} = \\frac{1}{8}$. Therefore, the number of products selected from this workshop should be $\\frac{1}{8} \\times 200 = 25$.\n\nLet's implement this calculation in Python to confirm the result.\n\n```python\n# Given values\ntotal_products = 2000\ntotal_sample_size = 200\nworkshop_products = 250\n\n# Calculate the proportion of products produced by the workshop\nproportion = workshop_products / total_products\n\n# Calculate the number of products selected from the workshop\nsample_from_workshop = proportion * total_sample_size\nprint(sample_from_workshop)\n```\n```output\n25.0\n```\nThe number of products selected from the workshop is \\(\\boxed{25}\\).\n\nIdentify a positive integer that is divisible by 14, has a square root between 25 and 25.3, and is also a perfect cube.\nTo solve this problem, we need to find a positive integer \\( n \\) that satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. \\( n \\) is divisible by 14.\n2. \\( 25 < \\sqrt{n} < 25.3 \\).\n3. \\( n \\) is a perfect cube.\n\nFirst, we will determine the range for \\( n \\) from the second condition. Since \\( 25 < \\sqrt{n} < 25.3 \\), we can square both sides of the inequality to get the range for \\( n \\):\n\n\\[ 25^2 < n < 25.3^2 \\]\n\\[ 625 < n < 640.09 \\]\n\nThus, \\( n \\) must be in the range from 626 to 640. Next, we need to check which of these numbers are divisible by 14 and are also perfect cubes. We will iterate through the numbers in this range, check for divisibility by 14, and check if they are perfect cubes.\n\nLet's write the Python code to find the correct number.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the range based on the square root condition\nlower_bound = 626\nupper_bound = 640\n\n# Function to check if a number is a perfect cube\ndef is_perfect_cube(n):\n    cube_root = round(n ** (1/3))\n    return cube_root ** 3 == n\n\n# Iterate through the range and find the number that meets all conditions\nfor n in range(lower_bound, upper_bound + 1):\n    if n % 1", 0.4099999964237213], ["0", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Including the area of its circular base, what is the total surface area of a hemisphere with radius \\( r \\)? Express your answer in terms of \\( \\pi \\).\n\nAssistant: To find the total surface area of a hemisphere with radius \\( r \\), we need to consider both the curved surface area of the hemisphere and the area of its circular base.\n\n1. The curved surface area of the hemisphere is half the surface area of a full sphere. Since the surface area of a full sphere is \\( 4\\pi r^2 \\), the curved surface area of the hemisphere is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4\\pi r^2 = 2\\pi r^2 \\).\n\n2. The area of the circular base of the hemisphere is the same as the area of a circle with radius \\( r \\). The area of a circle is \\( \\pi r^2 \\).\n\nSo, the total surface area of the hemisphere is the sum of the curved surface area and the area of the base:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total surface area} = 2\\pi r^2 + \\pi r^2 = 3\\pi r^2 \\]\n\nNow, let's confirm this with a Python code snippet.\n```python\n# Define the radius symbolically\nfrom sympy import symbols, pi\n\nr = symbols('r')\n\n# Curved surface area of the hemisphere\ncurved_surface_area = 2 * pi * r**2\n\n# Area of the circular base\nbase_area = pi * r**2\n\n# Total surface area of the hemisphere\ntotal_surface_area = curved_surface_area + base_area\nprint(total_surface_area)\n```\n```output\n3*pi*r**2\n```\nThe total surface area of a hemisphere with radius \\( r \\) is \\( 3\\pi r^2 \\).\n\nSo, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{3\\pi r^2}\\).\n\nHuman: Find the value of the expression $\\frac {x^2-x}{x+1} \\times \\frac {x^3-y^3}{x^3+y^3} \\div \\frac {x^2+xy+y^2}{x^2-y^2}$ when $x = 2$ and $y = 1$.\n\nAssistant: To find the value of the given expression when \\(x = 2\\) and \\(y = 1\\), we need to substitute these values into the expression and simplify step by step.

To find the fourth point of intersection between the circle and the parabola, we can use the properties of polynomials and the fact that the sum of the roots of a polynomial equation is related to the coefficients of the polynomial.\n\nLet's first set up the polynomial equation. Since the parabola is given by $y = x^2$, and the circle intersects the parabola at four points, the $y$-coordinates of these points are $x^2$. Thus, the points of intersection satisfy the equation $x^2 = mx + b$, where $m$ and $b$ are constants representing the circle's equation in the form $x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$. After substituting $y = x^2$, we can find the fourth intersection point.\n\nThe points of intersection are $(-28, 784)$, $(-2, 4)$, $(13, 169)$, and $(x_4, x_4^2)$. The sum of the $x$-coordinates of the points of intersection is the sum of the roots of the polynomial equation $x^2 - mx - b = 0$. According to Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of a polynomial $ax^n + bx^{n-1} + \\cdots + k = 0$ is $-b/a$. In this case, the polynomial is of the form $x^4 + \\cdots + \\text{constant} = 0$, and the sum of the roots is the negative of the coefficient of $x^3$ divided by the coefficient of $x^4$, which is 0 in this case. Therefore, the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the points of intersection is $-28 - 2 + 13 + x_4 = 0$, which gives us $x_4 = 17$.\n\nThe fourth point of intersection is $(17, 289)$.

To find the number of solutions in the interval $0 \\le x \\le \\tan^{-1} 942$, we need to determine the range of $k$ values that keep $x$ within this interval.\n\nFirst, we note that $\\tan^{-1} 942$ is slightly less than $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ because $\\tan \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$ is undefined and approaches infinity as the angle approaches $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. So, we have:\n\n\\[ 0 \\le x \\le \\tan^{-1} 942 < \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the values of $k$ such that $x = \\tan x + k\\pi$ lies within this interval. Since $\\tan x$ is bounded by $-\\infty$ and $\\infty$, we need to find the integer values of $k$ such that the equation $x = \\tan x + k\\pi$ has solutions in the interval $[0, \\tan^{-1} 942]$.\n\nWe can see that for $k = 0$, the equation $x = \\tan x$ has solutions in the interval $[0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$. For $k = 1$, the equation $x = \\tan x + \\pi$ will shift the solutions by $\\pi$, and for $k = -1$, the equation $x = \\tan x - \\pi$ will shift the solutions by $-\\pi$. Since $\\tan^{-1} 942$ is slightly less than $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, the only integer value of $k$ that keeps the solution within the interval is $k = 0$.\n\nTherefore, we only need to solve $x = \\tan x$ in the interval $[0, \\tan^{-1} 942]$.

The problem specifies that each vertex of the polygon has at least one even coordinate. We are asked to select one vertex from each polygon, ensuring that each pair of adjacent polygons shares a selected vertex. This means we need to select at least two vertices, one from each of two adjacent polygons, ensuring that the selected vertices maintain the condition of having at least one even coordinate. Let's denote the vertices of $P_1, P_2, P_3,$ and $P_4$ as $P_1^i, P_2^i, P_3^i,$ and $P_4^i$ respectively, where $i$ refers to the vertex number.\n\nGiven that each polygon's vertices share this condition, we can select a vertex from $P_1$ and $P_2$ such that the selected vertices in adjacent polygons maintain this condition. Since the polygons are disjoint, we can select any vertex that satisfies the condition in the respective polygon.\n\nTo illustrate, we can select any vertex from $P_1$ that has at least one even coordinate and then select the corresponding vertex from $P_2$ (or $P_4$) that shares the same coordinate value. The same applies to $P_3$.\n\n2. The problem states that the sum of the x-coordinates of the 100 vertices of the polygon $P_1$ is 2009. The midpoints of the sides of $P_1$ form a new polygon $P_2$, and the midpoints of the sides of $P_2$ form a new polygon $P_3$. We need to find the sum of the x-coordinates of the vertices of $P_3$.\n\nSince the vertices of $P_2$ are the midpoints of the sides of $P_1$, the sum of the x-coordinates of the vertices of $P_2$ is the same as the sum of the x-coordinates of the vertices of $P_1$. This is because the midpoint operation does not change the sum of the x-coordinates (since each vertex of $P_1$ is counted exactly once in the sum of the midpoints).\n\nSimilarly, the sum of the x-coordinates of the vertices of $P_3$ is the same as the sum of the x-coordinates of the vertices of $P_2$, which is the same as the sum of the x-coordinates of the vertices of $P_1$. Therefore, the sum of the x-coordinates of the vertices of $P_3$ is 2009.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Given sum of x-coordinates of P1\nsum_x_P1 = 2009\n\n# Since the sum of the x-coordinates is preserved through the midpoint operation\nsum_x_P3 = sum_x_P1\n\nprint(sum_x_P3)\n```\n```output\n2009\n```\nThe sum of the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of $P_3$ is \\(\\boxed{2009}\\).", 1.0], ["0", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.
