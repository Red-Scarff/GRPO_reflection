Plugging in the values, we get $97 = 1 + (n-1) \\cdot 2 \\implies 97 = 1 + 2n - 2 \\implies 98 = 2n \\implies n = 49$.

One possible way is to set \\(x = -\\frac{1}{3}\\), \\(y = -1\\), and \\(z = \\frac{7}{3}\\) and see if this satisfies the constraints and gives a maximum value.\n\n### Step 5: Use Python to Verify\nWe can use Python to verify the maximum value by checking the function value at various boundary points and also by using optimization techniques to find the maximum value.\n\nLet's implement this in Python.\n\n```python\nimport scipy.optimize as opt\n\n# Define the function to maximize\ndef objective(vars):\n    x, y, z = vars\n    return -(np.sqrt(3*x + 1) + np.sqrt(3*y + 3) + np.sqrt(3*z + 5))\n\n# Define the constraints\nconstraints = [\n    {'type': 'eq', 'fun': lambda vars: vars[0] + vars[1] + vars[2] - 1},\n    {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda vars: vars[0] + 1/3},\n    {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda vars: vars[1] + 1},\n    {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda vars: vars[2] + 5/3}\n]\n\n# Initial guess\ninitial_guess = [0, 0, 1]\n\n# Perform the optimization\nresult = opt.minimize(objective, initial_guess, constraints=constraints)\n\n# The maximum value is the negative of the minimized value\nmax_value = -result.fun\nprint(max_value)\n```\n\n### Step 6: Final Answer\nThe maximum value of \\(\\sqrt{3x + 1} + \\sqrt{3y + 3} + \\sqrt{3z + 5}\\) subject to the constraints \\(x + y + z = 1\\), \\(x \\ge -\\frac{1}{3}\\), \\(y \\ge -1\\), and \\(z \\ge -\\frac{5}{3}\\) is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).", 1.559999942779541], ["50", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Therefore, \\(t_n = \\frac{1}{t_{n-1}}\\).\n   - This implies \\(t_{n-1} = \\frac{87}{19}\\).\n   - Now, we need to determine the parity of \\(n-1\\):\n     - If \\(n-1\\) is even, then \\(t_{n-1} = 1 + t_{\\frac{n-1}{2}}\\). But \\(\\frac{87}{19}\\) is not an integer, so it cannot be of the form \\(1 + t_{\\frac{n-1}{2}}\\). Hence, \\(n-1\\) must be odd.\n     - If \\(n-1\\) is odd, then \\(t_{n-1} = \\frac{1}{t_{n-2}}\\). This gives us \\(t_{n-2} = \\frac{19}{87}\\).\n   - We can see that we are cycling through the same values, and it appears that \\(n-2 = k\\) where \\(t_k = \\frac{19}{87}\\).

We need to keep backtracking until we find the initial condition.\n\n5. **Finding the Pattern:**\n   - We notice that \\(t_{n-3} = \\frac{87}{19}\\) implies \\(t_{n-4} = 1 + t_{\\frac{n-4}{2}}\\) (since \\(\\frac{87}{19}\\) is not an integer, \\(\\frac{n-4}{2}\\) must be an integer, and \\(n-4\\) must be even).\n   - Continuing this process, we eventually find that \\(t_1 = 1\\).\n\n### Python Code to Verify\n\nLet's write a Python function to verify this step-by-step process and find the value of \\(n\\).\n\n```python\ndef find_n(t_n):\n    n = 1\n    while True:\n        if n == 1:\n            t_n = 1\n        elif n % 2 == 0:\n            t_n = 1 + t_n / 2\n        else:\n            t_n = 1 / t_n\n        if t_n == 19 / 87:\n            return n\n        n += 1\n\n# We need to find the value of n such that t_n = 19/87\nn = find_n(19 / 87)\nprint(n)\n```\n```output\ntimeout_decorator.timeout_decorator.TimeoutError: 'Timed Out'\n```\nIt seems that the previous approach might be inefficient due to the iterative nature of the problem.

Let's call the length of these two sides \\(a\\). Here, \\(a = 5\\) cm.\n   - The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of all its sides. Let's call the length of the base \\(b\\).\n   - The perimeter is given as 17 cm. So, we can write the equation for the perimeter as:\n     \\[\n     5 + 5 + b = 17\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying the equation, we get:\n     \\[\n     10 + b = 17\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\(b\\), we get:\n     \\[\n     b = 17 - 10 = 7\n     \\]\n\n2. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - Let's verify the solution by checking if the perimeter is indeed 17 cm when the base is 7 cm.

Let's reason through the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, consider the distance between the centers of the surrounding circles and the central circle. The distance between the center of any surrounding circle and the center of the central circle should be equal to the sum of their radii, i.e., $1 + r$.\n\nSince the surrounding circles are also tangent to each other, the distance between the centers of any two adjacent surrounding circles is $2r$.\n\nNow, let's visualize these centers forming a square. The centers of the four surrounding circles form a square with side length $2r$. The center of this square (which is also the center of the central circle) is equidistant from the centers of the surrounding circles. \n\nThe distance from the center of the square to one of its corners (the center of one of the surrounding circles) can be calculated as half of the diagonal of the square formed by the centers of the surrounding circles. The diagonal of this square is $\\sqrt{(2r)^2 + (2r)^2} = \\sqrt{8r^2} = 2\\sqrt{2}r$. Thus, the distance from the center of the square to one of its corners is $\\frac{2\\sqrt{2}r}{2} = \\sqrt{2}r$.\n\nThis distance from the center of the square to one of its corners is also the distance from the center of the central circle to the center of one of the surrounding circles minus the radius of the central circle. So, we have the equation:\n\\[ \\sqrt{2}r = 1 + r. \\]\nLet's solve this equation step by step.\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2}r = 1 + r\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2}r - r = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{2} - 1)r = 1\n\\]\n\\[\nr = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} - 1}\n\\]\nTo rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $\\sqrt{2} + 1$:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{1 \\cdot (\\sqrt{2} + 1)}{(\\sqrt{2} - 1)(\\sqrt{2} + 1)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} + 1}{2 - 1} = \\sqrt{2} + 1.\n\\]\nSo the value of $r$ is $\\sqrt{2} + 1$.

Let's confirm this with Python code.\n```python\n# Let's define the equations and solve them using Python\r\n\r\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\r\n\r\n# Define the variables\r\nJ, B = symbols('J B')\r\n\r\n# Define the equations\r\neq1 = Eq(J + B, 180)\r\neq2 = Eq(B - J, B / 2)\r\n\r\n# Solve the equations\r\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (J, B))\r\nprint(solution)\n```\n```output\n{B: 120, J: 60}\n```\nThe solution to the equations is \\( J = 60 \\) and \\( B = 120 \\).
