Determine the number of loops she should run per day.\n\nFirst, we'll calculate the total number of loops she needs to run in a week. Since she wants to run 3500 meters per week and the track is 50 meters around, the number of loops she needs to run in a week is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total loops per week} = \\frac{3500 \\text{ meters}}{50 \\text{ meters/loop}} = 70 \\text{ loops} \\]\n\nNext, we'll determine the number of loops she should run per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of loops by 7:\n\n\\[ \\text{Loops per day} = \\frac{70 \\text{ loops}}{7 \\text{ days}} = 10 \\text{ loops/day} \\]\n\nSo, Tammy should run 10 loops per day. Let's confirm this with Python code.\n```python\n# Constants\ntotal_meters_per_week = 3500\ntrack_length_meters = 50\ndays_per_week = 7\n\n# Calculate total loops per week\ntotal_loops_per_week = total_meters_per_week // track_length_meters\n\n# Calculate loops per day\nloops_per_day = total_loops_per_week // days_per_week\nprint(loops_per_day)\n```\n```output\n10\n```\nThe calculation confirms that Tammy should run \\(\\boxed{10}\\) loops per day to reach her goal of running 3500 meters per week.\n\nIn a physical education class, students line up in four rows to do exercises.

Since \\(P\\) is 7 units from \\(\\overline{BG}\\) and 5 units from \\(\\overline{BC}\\), the coordinates of \\(P\\) in the cube are \\((5, 7, 12)\\) if we place \\(A\\) at \\((0, 0, 0)\\) and the cube has side length 12.\n\n2. **Reflect the Path**: When the light beam reflects off a face of the cube, it continues in a straight line in the reflected cube. To find the next vertex it hits, we can extend this line in the grid of cubes.\n\n3. **Calculate the Path Length**: The path length from \\(A\\) to the next vertex it hits can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions.

So the coordinates of the next vertex are \\((36, 38, -19)\\), but we need to consider the absolute values since we are in a grid of cubes.\n\nThe actual coordinates in the cube are \\((12, 2, 1)\\). The distance from \\(A\\) to this vertex is the length of the line segment from \\((0, 0, 0)\\) to \\((12, 2, 1)\\), which is:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{12^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 4 + 1} = \\sqrt{149}\n\\]\nSo the length of the light path is \\(14\\sqrt{149}\\), and the values of \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are 14 and 149, respectively.

One effective way to do this is by using a method known as \"unfolding\" the cube, which allows us to model the reflections by extending the cube in a grid pattern.\n\nGiven that the cube has side length 12, and the point \\(P\\) on face \\(BCFG\\) is 7 units from \\(\\overline{BG}\\) and 5 units from \\(\\overline{BC}\\), we can represent the coordinates of \\(P\\) as \\((5, 7)\\) in a coordinate system with \\(B\\) at the origin \\((0, 0)\\), \\(C\\) at \\((12, 0)\\), \\(F\\) at \\((0, 12)\\), and \\(G\\) at \\((12, 12)\\).\n\nWhen the light beam reflects off a face of the cube, it changes direction in a predictable way. By unfolding the cube, we can represent the path of the light beam as a straight line in a grid of cubes. The light beam will travel in a straight line until it reaches another vertex of the cube.\n\nTo find the coordinates where the light beam next reaches a vertex, we need to find the smallest integer coordinates \\((x, y)\\) such that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are integer multiples of 12. The coordinates of the next vertex will be \\((12k, 12m)\\) for some integers \\(k\\) and \\(m\\).\n\nThe path length from \\(A\\) to \\(P\\) and then to the next vertex can be calculated using the Euclidean distance formula. The coordinates of \\(A\\) are \\((0, 0, 0)\\), and the coordinates of \\(P\\) are \\((5, 7, 12)\\). To find the next vertex, we need to find the smallest \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) such that the coordinates \\((12k, 12m, 12n)\\) are reached by extending the line from \\(A\\) through \\(P\\).\n\nThe direction vector from \\(A\\) to \\(P\\) is \\((5, 7, 12)\\). To find the next vertex, we need to find the smallest \\(k\\) such that the coordinates are integer multiples of 12. The coordinates of the next vertex will be \\((12k, 12m, 12n)\\), and the direction vector will be scaled to \\((12k/5, 12m/7, 12n/12)\\).\n\nWe can use the least common multiple (LCM) to find the smallest \\(k\\) and \\(m\\). The LCM of 5 and 7 is 35, so the next vertex will be at \\((12 \\cdot 7, 12 \\cdot 5, 12 \\cdot 35/35) = (84, 60, 12)\\).\n\nThe length of the light path from \\(A\\) to this vertex can be calculated using the Euclidean distance formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Length} = \\sqrt{(84-0)^2 + (60-0)^2 + (12-0)^2} = \\sqrt{84^2 + 60^2 + 12^2} = \\sqrt{7056 + 3600 + 144} = \\sqrt{10800} = 60\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\nThus, the length of the light path is \\(60\\sqrt{3}\\), and the values of \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are 60 and 3, respectively.

The non-zero digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (each appearing once), so \\(S_1 = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{9}\\).\n   - For \\(n=2\\), the numbers are from 1 to 100. Each digit from 1 to 9 appears 19 times in the tens and units places combined (e.g., 1 appears in 10, 11, 12, ..., 19, and also in 10, 20, 30, ..., 90), so \\(S_2 = 19 \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{9}\\right)\\).\n   - For general \\(n\\), each digit from 1 to 9 appears \\(10^{n-1} \\times n\\) times in total (since there are \\(10^{n-1}\\) choices for the positions of the digits and \\(n\\) positions).\n\n   Therefore, \\(S_n = 10^{n-1} \\times n \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{9}\\right)\\).\n\n3. **Simplifying the Sum:**\n   - Let \\(H_9 = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{9}\\), which is a known sum.\n   - We need to find the smallest \\(n\\) such that \\(10^{n-1} \\times n \\times H_9\\) is an integer.\n\n4. **Finding the Denominator of \\(H_9\\):**\n   - The least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 1 through 9 is 2520. So, \\(H_9 = \\frac{A}{2520}\\) for some integer \\(A\\).\n\n5. **Condition for \\(S_n\\) to be an Integer:**\n   - For \\(S_n = 10^{n-1} \\times n \\times \\frac{A}{2520}\\) to be an integer, \\(10^{n-1} \\times n\\) must be divisible by 2520.\n   - Since \\(2520 = 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\times 7\\), \\(10^{n-1} \\times n\\) must include these factors.\n   - \\(10^{n-1} = 2^{n-1} \\times 5^{n-1}\\) already includes \\(2^3\\) and \\(5\\) when \\(n \\geq 4\\).\n   - We need \\(n\\) to include \\(3^2\\) and \\(7\\), so the smallest \\(n\\) that satisfies this is \\(n = 2520\\).\n\nLet's verify this using Python and sympy:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the sum H_9\nH_9 = sum(sp.Rational(1, i) for i in range(1, 10))\n\n# Find the smallest n such that 10^(n-1) * n * H_9 is an integer\ndef find_smallest_n(H_9):\n    lcm_denominator = sp.lcm([i for i in range(1, 10)])\n    n = 1\n    while True:\n        if (10**(n-1) * n * H_9).q == 1:\n            return n\n        n += 1\n\nsmallest_n = find_smallest_n(H_9)\nprint(smallest_n)\n```\n```output\ntimeout_decorator.timeout_decorator.TimeoutError: 'Timed Out'\n```\nIt seems like the code took too long to execute.

The digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (1 appears 10 times, 2 through 9 appear once each).\n   - For \\(n=2\\), the numbers are from 1 to 100.
