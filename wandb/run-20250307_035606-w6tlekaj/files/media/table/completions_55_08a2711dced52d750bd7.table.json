Find the largest two-digit integer that is congruent to \\(1 \\mod 3\\).\n4. Determine the number of integers between these two values that are congruent to \\(1 \\mod 3\\).\n\nLet's break this down step-by-step:\n\n1. The smallest two-digit integer is 10. We need to check if 10 is congruent to \\(1 \\mod 3\\):\n   \\[\n   10 \\div 3 = 3 \\text{ remainder } 1 \\implies 10 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3\n   \\]\n   So, 10 is indeed congruent to \\(1 \\mod 3\\).\n\n2.

The sequence of these integers forms an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 3:\n   \\[\n   10, 13, 16, \\ldots, 97\n   \\]\n   The number of terms in this arithmetic progression can be determined using the formula for the \\(n\\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:\n   \\[\n   a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \\cdot d\n   \\]\n   where \\(a_n\\) is the last term, \\(a_1\\) is the first term, \\(d\\) is the common difference, and \\(n\\) is the number of terms.

We start with the equation for \\( x \\):\n\\[ x = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{53}}{2} + \\frac{3}{2}}. \\]\nTo simplify the expression inside the square root, we can let \\( y = \\frac{\\sqrt{53}}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} \\), so that:\n\\[ x^2 = y = \\frac{\\sqrt{53} + 3}{2}. \\]\nWe need to express \\( \\sqrt{53} \\) in terms of \\( x \\). To do this, we isolate \\( \\sqrt{53} \\):\n\\[ 2x^2 = \\sqrt{53} + 3, \\]\n\\[ 2x^2 - 3 = \\sqrt{53}. \\]\nNow we square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\\[ (2x^2 - 3)^2 = 53, \\]\n\\[ 4x^4 - 12x^2 + 9 = 53, \\]\n\\[ 4x^4 - 12x^2 - 44 = 0, \\]\n\\[ x^4 - 3x^2 - 11 = 0. \\]\nThis gives us the polynomial equation satisfied by \\( x \\):\n\\[ x^4 = 3x^2 + 11. \\]\nNow we will use this equation to reduce higher powers of \\( x \\). For example:\n\\[ x^6 = x^2 \\cdot x^4 = x^2 (3x^2 + 11) = 3x^4 + 11x^2 = 3(3x^2 + 11) + 11x^2 = 9x^2 + 33 + 11x^2 = 20x^2 + 33. \\]\nWe can use this pattern to reduce \\( x^{100} \\) step by step, but it will be more efficient to use the recurrence relation derived from \\( x^4 = 3x^2 + 11 \\) in the context of the given equation:\n\\[ x^{100} = 2x^{98} + 14x^{96} + 11x^{94} - x^{50} + ax^{46} + bx^{44} + cx^{40}. \\]\nWe can use Python to handle the polynomial manipulations and find the coefficients \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\). Let's start by defining the recurrence relation and then solving for the coefficients.\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variable and the recurrence relation\nx = sp.symbols('x')\nrecurrence = sp.Eq(x**4, 3*x**2 + 11)\n\n# Function to reduce higher powers of x using the recurrence relation\ndef reduce_power(expr):\n    expr = expr.expand()\n    while expr.has(x**4):\n        expr = expr.subs(x**4, 3*x**2 + 11).expand()\n    return expr\n\n# Define the given equation\nlhs = reduce_power(x**100)\nrhs = reduce_power(2*x**98 + 14*x**96 + 11*x**94 - x**50 + sp.symbols('a')*x**46 + sp.symbols('b')*x**44 + sp.symbols('c')*x**40)\n\n# Extract coefficients of x^46, x^44, and x^40\ncoeffs = sp.solve(sp.Eq(lhs, rhs), (sp.symbols('a'), sp.symbols('b'), sp.symbols('c')))\na = coeffs[sp.symbols('a')]\nb = coeffs[sp.symbols('b')]\nc = coeffs[sp.symbols('c')]\n\n# Calculate the sum a + b + c\nresult = a + b + c\nprint((a, b, c, result))\n```\n```output\n(0, 0, 0, 0)\n```\nIt seems there was an error in the approach. Let's verify the polynomial reduction step by step. We should ensure that we correctly apply the recurrence relation \\( x^4 = 3x^2 + 11 \\) to reduce the powers of \\( x \\) in the given equation.\n\nLet's manually reduce the powers step by step and then verify the coefficients.\n\n1. Start with \\( x^4 = 3x^2 + 11 \\).\n2.

Calculate the dimensions of the enlarged picture.\n2. Calculate the dimensions of the enlarged picture including the border.\n3. Calculate the perimeter of the enlarged picture including the border.\n4. Determine the minimum amount of framing that can be purchased, which must be a multiple of 10 cm and must be at least equal to the perimeter calculated in step 3.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n1. The original dimensions of the picture are 10 cm by 15 cm. When these dimensions are tripled, the new dimensions become 30 cm by 45 cm.\n2. A 5 cm-wide border is added around each side of the enlarged picture. So, the dimensions including the border are \\(30 + 2 \\times 5 = 40\\) cm by \\(45 + 2 \\times 5 = 55\\) cm.\n3. The perimeter of the enlarged picture including the border is \\(2 \\times (40 + 55) = 2 \\times 95 = 190\\) cm.\n4. Since framing is sold only in increments of 10 cm, the minimum amount of framing that must be purchased is the smallest multiple of 10 cm that is at least 190 cm.
