Then the equation becomes:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -4 \\\\ 3 & -2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a + 3b & -4a - 2b \\\\ c + 3d & -4c - 2d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -16 & -6 \\\\ 7 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nThis gives us the following system of equations:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\na + 3b = -16, \\\\\n-4a - 2b = -6, \\\\\nc + 3d = 7, \\\\\n-4c - 2d = 2.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nWe can solve these equations step-by-step.\n\n### Solving the first pair of equations:\n1. From $a + 3b = -16$, we get $a = -16 - 3b$.\n2. Substitute $a = -16 - 3b$ into $-4a - 2b = -6$:\n   \\[\n   -4(-16 - 3b) - 2b = -6 \\implies 64 + 12b - 2b = -6 \\implies 64 + 10b = -6 \\implies 10b = -70 \\implies b = -7.\n   \\]\n3. Substitute $b = -7$ back into $a = -16 - 3b$:\n   \\[\n   a = -16 - 3(-7) = -16 + 21 = 5.\n   \\]\nSo, we have $a = 5$ and $b = -7$.\n\n### Solving the second pair of equations:\n1. From $c + 3d = 7$, we get $c = 7 - 3d$.\n2. Substitute $c = 7 - 3d$ into $-4c - 2d = 2$:\n   \\[\n   -4(7 - 3d) - 2d = 2 \\implies -28 + 12d - 2d = 2 \\implies -28 + 10d = 2 \\implies 10d = 30 \\implies d = 3.\n   \\]\n3. Substitute $d = 3$ back into $c = 7 - 3d$:\n   \\[\n   c = 7 - 3(3) = 7 - 9 = -2.\n   \\]\nSo, we have $c = -2$ and $d = 3$.\n\nTherefore, the matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ is:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M} = \\begin{pmatrix} 5 & -7 \\\\ -2 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nLet's verify this solution using Python code.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\n# Given matrices\r\nA = np.array([[1, -4], [3, -2]])\r\nB = np.array([[-16, -6], [7, 2]])\r\n\r\n# Calculate the inverse of A\r\nA_inv = np.linalg.inv(A)\r\n\r\n# Calculate matrix M\r\nM = B @ A_inv\r\nprint(M)\n```\n```output\n[[ 5. -7.]\n [-2.  3.]]\n```\nThe calculated matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ is indeed:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M} = \\begin{pmatrix} 5 & -7 \\\\ -2 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nSo, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 5 & -7 \\\\ -2 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}}\n\\]", 1.4500000476837158], ["45", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

The triangle inequality conditions are \\(a + b > c\\), \\(a + c > b\\), and \\(b + c > a\\).\n\n2. **Analyze the Expression**:\n   To find the greatest constant \\(M\\), it's useful to consider the extreme cases, particularly when the triangle is nearly degenerate (i.e., \\(a \\approx b\\) and \\(c \\approx 0\\)). The expression \\(\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{c^2}\\) should be minimized over all possible triangles.\n\n3. **Consider Special Cases**:\n   Let's consider the case where the triangle is isosceles and nearly degenerate. If \\(a = b\\) and \\(c\\) is very small, then \\(a + a > c\\) (which is true for small \\(c\\)). In this case, we have \\(a^2 + a^2 > c^2\\), or \\(2a^2 > c^2\\).

However, we need to ensure \\(M\\) is the greatest constant that works for all triangles, not just this specific case.\n\n4. **General Triangle Consideration**:\n   For a general triangle, we can use the fact that \\(c\\) must be less than \\(a + b\\). To find the minimum value of \\(\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{c^2}\\), we can use the Law of Cosines in a triangle:\n   \\[\n   c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos(\\gamma)\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\gamma\\) is the angle opposite side \\(c\\). Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{a^2 + b^2}{c^2} = \\frac{a^2 + b^2}{a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos(\\gamma)}\n   \\]\n   To minimize this expression, we need to maximize \\(\\cos(\\gamma)\\). The maximum value of \\(\\cos(\\gamma)\\) is 1, which occurs when \\(\\gamma = 0\\). However, \\(\\gamma\\) cannot be 0 in a valid triangle. The next best case is when \\(\\gamma \\to 0\\), so \\(\\cos(\\gamma) \\approx 1\\). In this case, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{a^2 + b^2}{c^2} \\approx \\frac{a^2 + b^2}{a^2 + b^2 - 2ab} = \\frac{a^2 + b^2}{(a - b)^2}\n   \\]\n   The minimum value of this expression is 1, which occurs when \\(a = b\\). However, we need to check if there is a smaller value for general \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   By considering the general case and the special case of an isosceles triangle with \\(a = b\\), we see that the minimum value of \\(\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{c^2}\\) is 1.
