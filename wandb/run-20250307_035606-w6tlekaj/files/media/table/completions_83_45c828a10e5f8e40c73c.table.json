Then, we'll determine how many complete rolls can be made from these combined totals, and calculate the number of leftover quarters and dimes. Finally, we'll determine the dollar value of these leftover quarters and dimes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Combine the quarters and dimes from both James and Lindsay:**\n   - James has 83 quarters and 159 dimes.\n   - Lindsay has 129 quarters and 266 dimes.\n   - Combined, they have \\(83 + 129 = 212\\) quarters and \\(159 + 266 = 425\\) dimes.\n\n2. **Determine how many complete rolls can be made:**\n   - A roll of quarters contains 40 quarters. So, the number of complete rolls of quarters is \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{212}{40} \\right\\rfloor = 5 \\) rolls. This leaves \\(212 - 5 \\times 40 = 12\\) quarters leftover.\n   - A roll of dimes contains 50 dimes. So, the number of complete rolls of dimes is \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{425}{50} \\right\\rfloor = 8 \\) rolls. This leaves \\(425 - 8 \\times 50 = 25\\) dimes leftover.\n\n3. **Calculate the dollar value of the leftover quarters and dimes:**\n   - Each quarter is worth $0.25, so 12 quarters are worth \\(12 \\times 0.25 = 3\\) dollars.\n   - Each dime is worth $0.10, so 25 dimes are worth \\(25 \\times 0.10 = 2.5\\) dollars.\n   - Therefore, the total dollar value of the leftover quarters and dimes is \\(3 + 2.5 = 5.5\\) dollars.\n\nLet's now implement this step-by-step solution in Python to ensure accuracy.\n```python\n# Step 1: Combine the quarters and dimes from both James and Lindsay\nquarters_total = 83 + 129\ndimes_total = 159 + 266\n\n# Step 2: Determine how many complete rolls can be made\nquarters_per_roll = 40\ndimes_per_roll = 50\n\nrolls_of_quarters = quarters_total // quarters_per_roll\nleftover_quarters = quarters_total % quarters_per_roll\n\nrolls_of_dimes = dimes_total // dimes_per_roll\nleftover_dimes = dimes_total % dimes_per_roll\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the dollar value of the leftover quarters and dimes\nvalue_of_leftover_quarters = leftover_quarters * 0.25\nvalue_of_leftover_dimes = leftover_dimes * 0.10\n\n# Total dollar value of the leftover quarters and dimes\ntotal_leftover_value = value_of_leftover_quarters + value_of_leftover_dimes\n\nprint((leftover_quarters, leftover_dimes, total_leftover_value))\n```\n```output\n(12, 25, 5.5)\n```\nThe calculations show that there are 12 leftover quarters and 25 leftover dimes.

Find the divisors of 50.\n2. Calculate the product of these divisors.\n\nThe divisors of 50 are 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50. \n\nNow, we need to find the product of these divisors. Instead of calculating it directly, which would be tedious, we can use a mathematical property. The product of the divisors of a number \\( n \\) is given by \\( n^{d/2} \\), where \\( d \\) is the number of divisors of \\( n \\).\n\nHere, the number of divisors of 50 is 6.

Calculate the sum of the first five terms:\n   - $S_5 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 1 + 3 + 7 + 15 + 31$\n\nLet's use Python to compute this step-by-step to ensure accuracy.\n```python\n# Initialize the first term\na = [1]\n\n# Calculate the next four terms\nfor n in range(1, 5):\n    a.append(2 * a[-1] + 1)\n\n# Calculate the sum of the first five terms\nS_5 = sum(a)\nprint((a, S_5))\n```\n```output\n([1, 3, 7, 15, 31], 57)\n```\nThe first five terms of the sequence are $1, 3, 7, 15,$ and $31$.

According to the problem, the total points scored by both teams is 34, so we can write the equation: \n   \\[\n   C + P = 34\n   \\]\n4. The Cougars won by a margin of 14 points, which means the points scored by the Cougars are 14 more than the points scored by the Panthers. So we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   C = P + 14\n   \\]\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n1. \\( C + P = 34 \\)\n2. \\( C = P + 14 \\)\n\nWe can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \\( P \\):\n\\[\n(P + 14) + P = 34\n\\]\nSimplify and solve for \\( P \\):\n\\[\n2P + 14 = 34 \\\\\n2P = 20 \\\\\nP = 10\n\\]\n\nSo the Panthers scored 10 points. Let's confirm this by calculating the points scored by the Cougars and verifying the margin of victory:\n\\[\nC = P + 14 = 10 + 14 = 24\n\\]\n\\[\nC + P = 24 + 10 = 34\n\\]\nThe margin of victory is:\n\\[\n24 - 10 = 14\n\\]\nThis confirms our solution. The Panthers scored 10 points.\n\nLet's use Python code to verify this solution.\n```python\n# Define the total points and the margin of victory\ntotal_points = 34\nmargin_of_victory = 14\n\n# Calculate the points scored by the Panthers\npoints_panthers = (total_points - margin_of_victory) / 2\n\n# Calculate the points scored by the Cougars", 1.5099999904632568], ["45", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

The Kobish alphabet has 26 letters, just like our English alphabet. Here's how we can approach the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of 4-letter words possible with the Kobish alphabet. Since each position in the word can be any of the 26 letters, the total number of 4-letter words is \\(26^4\\).\n2. Calculate the number of 4-letter words that do not contain the letter 'A'. Each position in the word can be any of the 25 letters (since 'A' is excluded), so the number of 4-letter words without the letter 'A' is \\(25^4\\).\n3. The number of 4-letter words that contain the letter 'A' at least once is the total number of 4-letter words minus the number of 4-letter words that do not contain the letter 'A'. This is \\(26^4 - 25^4\\).\n4. The fraction of all possible 4-letter words that contain the letter 'A' at least once is \\(\\frac{26^4 - 25^4}{26^4}\\).\n\nLet's calculate this step-by-step using Python code.\n\nFirst, we calculate \\(26^4\\) and \\(25^4\\).

The equation provided is \\(y^2 + 6y + 2x + 5 = 0\\).\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the equation and convert to vertex form\nTo find the vertex of the parabola, we need to rewrite the equation in a more manageable form. The equation given is in a form where \\(y\\) is the independent variable, and it is a quadratic equation in \\(y\\). We can complete the square for the \\(y\\)-terms.\n\n### Step 2: Complete the square for the \\(y\\)-terms\nThe equation \\(y^2 + 6y + 2x + 5 = 0\\) can be rewritten by completing the square:\n\n\\[y^2 + 6y = (y + 3)^2 - 9.\\]\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\\[(y + 3)^2 - 9 + 2x + 5 = 0.\\]\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\\[(y + 3)^2 + 2x - 4 = 0.\\]\nRearranging terms, we get:\n\\[(y + 3)^2 = -2x + 4.\\]\nThis can be written as:\n\\[(y + 3)^2 = -2(x - 2).\\]\nThis is the standard form of a parabola \\((y - k)^2 = 4p(x - h)\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the vertex.
