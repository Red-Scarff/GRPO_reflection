Substituting the parametric equations into the sphere equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   (2 - 3t)^2 + (3 - 6t)^2 + (4 - 7t)^2 = 1\n   \\]\n   Expanding and simplifying this equation:\n   \\[\n   4 - 12t + 9t^2 + 9 - 36t + 36t^2 + 16 - 56t + 49t^2 = 1\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   94t^2 - 104t + 29 = 1\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   94t^2 - 104t + 28 = 0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   47t^2 - 52t + 14 = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:**\n   Using the quadratic formula $t = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, we solve for $t$:\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{52 \\pm \\sqrt{52^2 - 4 \\cdot 47 \\cdot 14}}{2 \\cdot 47}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{52 \\pm \\sqrt{2704 - 2632}}{94}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{52 \\pm \\sqrt{72}}{94}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{52 \\pm 6\\sqrt{2}}{94} = \\frac{26 \\pm 3\\sqrt{2}}{47}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Intersection Points:**\n   Substituting $t = \\frac{26 + 3\\sqrt{2}}{47}$ and $t = \\frac{26 - 3\\sqrt{2}}{47}$ into the parametric equations, we get the intersection points.\n\n5. **Distance Between Intersection Points:**\n   The distance between the intersection points can be found by calculating the Euclidean distance between the two points:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2 + (z_1 - z_2)^2}\n   \\]\n   Let's calculate this using Python for accuracy.\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\r\n\r\n# Define the parameter t\r\nt = sp.symbols('t')\r\n\r\n# Parametric equations of the line\r\nx = 2 - 3*t\r\ny = 3 - 6*t\r\nz = 4 - 7*t\r\n\r\n# Equation of the unit sphere\r\nsphere_eq = x**2 + y**2 + z**2 - 1\r\n\r\n# Solve for t\r\nt_solutions = sp.solve(sphere_eq, t)\r\nt1, t2 = t_solutions\r\n\r\n# Calculate the intersection points\r\nx1, y1, z1 = x.subs(t, t1), y.subs(t, t1), z.subs(t, t1)\r\nx2, y2, z2 = x.subs(t, t2), y.subs(t, t2), z.subs(t, t2)\r\n\r\n# Calculate the distance between the intersection points\r\ndistance = sp.sqrt((x1 - x2)**2 + (y1 - y2)**2 + (z1 - z2)**2)\r\nprint(distance.simplify())\n```\n```output\n6*sqrt(13)/47\n```\nThe distance between the two", 0.0], ["0", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

This can be computed by summing up the probabilities for \\( k = 4, 5, 6, 7 \\).\n\n2. We set \\( n = 7 \\) and \\( p = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nLet's write the Python code to compute this probability.\n```python\nfrom math import comb\n\n# Number of games and probability of winning each game\nn = 7\np = 0.5\n\n# Calculate the probability of winning at least 4 games\nprobability_at_least_4_wins = sum(comb(n, k) * (p**k) * ((1-p)**(n-k)) for k in range(4, 8))\nprint(probability_at_least_4_wins)\n```\n```output\n0.5\n```\nThe probability that the Badgers will win at least four games out of seven is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nExpressing this as a common fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\]", 1.0], ["0", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

This implies that the vertical asymptote of $g(x)$ is also $x = 2$, which means $d = 2$.\n\n2. **Oblique asymptotes:**\n   The oblique asymptote of $f(x)$ can be found by performing polynomial long division on $\\frac{x^2 - 6x + 6}{2x - 4}$. After division, we get:\n   \\[\n   f(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x - 2 + \\frac{2}{2x - 4} \\implies \\text{Oblique asymptote: } y = \\frac{1}{2}x - 2.\n   \\]\n   The oblique asymptote of $g(x)$ can be found similarly.

So, $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot a = -1 \\implies a = -2$. The intersection of the oblique asymptotes on the $y$-axis occurs when $x = 0$:\n   \\[\n   f(0) = \\frac{6}{-4} = -\\frac{3}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad g(0) = 2a + b = -4 + b.\n   \\]\n   Since they intersect on the $y$-axis, we have $-\\frac{3}{2} = -4 + b \\implies b = \\frac{5}{2}$.\n\n3. **Intersection points:**\n   We know that $f(x) = g(x)$ at $x = -2$. So, we can find $c$ by substituting $x = -2$ in both functions:\n   \\[\n   f(-2) = \\frac{(-2)^2 - 6(-2) + 6}{2(-2) - 4} = \\frac{4 + 12 + 6}{-4 - 4} = \\frac{22}{-8} = -\\frac{11}{4}.\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   g(-2) = \\frac{-2(-2)^2 + \\frac{5}{2}(-2) + c}{-2 - 2} = \\frac{-8 - 5 + c}{-4} = \\frac{-13 + c}{-4}.\n   \\]\n   Since $f(-2) = g(-2)$, we have:\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{11}{4} = \\frac{-13 + c}{-4} \\implies -11 = 13 - c \\implies c = 24.\n   \\]\n   So, $g(x) = \\frac{-2x^2 + \\frac{5}{2}x + 24}{x - 2}$.\n\n4. **Find the other intersection point:**\n   To find the other intersection point, we need to solve $f(x) = g(x)$.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n1. **Vertical Asymptote:**\n   The vertical asymptote of \\(f(x)\\) is where the denominator is zero, i.e., \\(2x - 4 = 0\\), so \\(x = 2\\). Since \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) have the same vertical asymptote, \\(g(x)\\) must also have \\(x = 2\\) as its vertical asymptote. This means the denominator of \\(g(x)\\) must be \\(x - 2\\), so \\(d = 2\\).\n\n2. **Oblique Asymptotes:**\n   The oblique asymptote of \\(f(x)\\) can be found by performing polynomial long division of the numerator by the denominator:\n   \\[\n   f(x) = \\frac{x^2 - 6x + 6}{2x - 4} = \\frac{1}{2}x - 1 + \\frac{2}{2x - 4} = \\frac{1}{2}x - 1 + \\frac{1}{x - 2}.\n   \\]\n   So, the oblique asymptote of \\(f(x)\\) is \\(y = \\frac{1}{2}x - 1\\).\n\n   The oblique asymptote of \\(g(x)\\) can be found similarly by performing polynomial long division of the numerator by the denominator. Since the degree of the numerator is one more than the degree of the denominator, we can write:\n   \\[\n   g(x) = \\frac{ax^2 + bx + c}{x - 2} = ax + (b + 2a) + \\frac{c + 2b + 4a}{x - 2}.\n   \\]\n   So, the oblique asymptote of \\(g(x)\\) is \\(y = ax + (b + 2a)\\).\n\n   According to the problem, the oblique asymptotes are perpendicular and intersect on the y-axis. The slope of the oblique asymptote of \\(f(x)\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), so the slope of the oblique asymptote of \\(g(x)\\) must be \\(-2\\) (since perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals of each other).

So let's find $f(-2)$ and $g(-2)$:\n\\[\nf(-2) = \\frac{(-2)^2 - 6(-2) + 6}{2(-2) - 4} = \\frac{4 + 12 + 6}{-4 - 4} = \\frac{22}{-8} = -\\frac{11}{4}.\n\\]\n\\[\ng(-2) = \\frac{-2(-2)^2 + 2(-2) + c}{-2 - 2} = \\frac{-8 - 4 + c}{-4} = \\frac{-12 + c}{-4} = \\frac{c - 12}{-4}.\n\\]\nSince $f(-2) = g(-2)$, we have:\n\\[\n-\\frac{11}{4} = \\frac{c - 12}{-4} \\implies -11 = -c + 12 \\implies c = 23.\n\\]\nSo $g(x) = \\frac{-2x^2 + 2x + 23}{x - 2}$.\n\n### Step 4: Intersection Point that Does Not Lie on $x = -2$\n\nWe need to find the other intersection point of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$.

Since 133 is odd, the pairs \\((1, 133)\\) and \\((133, 1)\\) will not work because the sum and difference are not even. The pairs \\((7, 19)\\) and \\((19, 7)\\) will work because both 7 and 19 are odd.\n\nLet's use the pair \\((7, 19)\\):\n\n\\[a = \\frac{7 + 19}{2} = \\frac{26}{2} = 13\\]\n\\[b = \\frac{19 - 7}{2} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6\\]\n\nSo, the perfect squares are \\(13^2 = 169\\) and \\(6^2 = 36\\). The sum of these squares is:\n\n\\[169 + 36 = 205\\]\n\nWe should verify that this is indeed the smallest possible sum by checking the other pair \\((19, 7)\\):\n\n\\[a = \\frac{19 + 7}{2} = \\frac{26}{2} = 13\\]\n\\[b = \\frac{19 - 7}{2} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6\\]\n\nThis gives the same perfect squares and sum as before. Therefore, the smallest possible sum of the two perfect squares is:\n\n\\[\\boxed{205}\\]\n\nLet's write the Python code to confirm this result.\n```python\n# Define the function to find the smallest sum of the two perfect squares\ndef find_smallest_sum(difference):\n    # Find all pairs of factors of the difference\n    factors = [(x, difference // x) for x in range(1, int(difference**0.5) + 1) if difference % x == 0]\n    # Check each pair to find valid (a, b)\n    min_sum = float('inf')\n    for x, y in factors:\n        if (x + y) % 2 == 0 and (y - x) % 2 == 0:\n            a = (x + y) // 2\n            b = (y - x) // 2\n            sum_of_squares = a**2 + b**2\n            if sum_of_squares < min_sum:\n                min_sum = sum_of_squares\n    return min_sum\n\n# Calculate the smallest sum of the two perfect squares\nsmallest_sum = find_smallest_sum(133)\nprint(smallest_sum)\n```", 1.3899999856948853], ["0", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.
