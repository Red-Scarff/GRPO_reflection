To solve this problem, we need to calculate the actual price per pair of socks after the promotion. The promotion \"buy five, get one free\" means that for every six pairs of socks purchased, the customer only pays for five pairs.

The first part is a rectangle with vertices (0, 0), (0, 2), (3, 2), and (3, 0). The area of this rectangle is \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\).\n3.

What is the total length of all segments in the teragon after the second iteration? Express your answer as a fraction in simplest form.\n\nAssistant: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total length of all segments in the teragon after the second iteration. Let's break down the process step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Triangle**: The initial equilateral triangle has a side length of 1, so the total length is \\(3 \\times 1 = 3\\).\n\n2. **First Iteration**: Each side of the triangle is replaced by a motif made of four segments, each being \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) the length of the original side. So, each side becomes \\(4 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}\\). Since there are three sides, the total length after the first iteration is \\(3 \\times \\frac{4}{3} = 4\\).\n\n3. **Second Iteration**: Each segment from the first iteration is again replaced by a motif made of four segments, each being \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) the length of the original segment. So, each segment of length \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) becomes \\(4 \\times \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{4}{9}\\). Since there are \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\) segments from the first iteration, the total length after the second iteration is \\(12 \\times \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{48}{9} = \\frac{16}{3}\\).\n\nLet's confirm this with Python code to ensure accuracy.\n```python\n# Initial side length", 1.4700000286102295], ["30", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

This gives us the interval $(0, 6)$.\n2. **Analyze the argument of the logarithm:** Let $g(x) = 6x - x^2$. The function $g(x)$ is a parabola opening downwards with a maximum at $x = 3$. The function $g(x)$ is increasing on the interval $(0, 3)$ and decreasing on the interval $(3, 6)$.\n3. **Consider the base of the logarithm:** The base of the logarithm is $0.6$, which is between 0 and 1. For a logarithm with a base between 0 and 1, the function is decreasing when the argument is increasing, and increasing when the argument is decreasing. So, since $g(x)$ is increasing on $(0, 3)$, $f(x) = \\log_{0.6}(6x - x^2)$ will be decreasing on $(0, 3)$. Similarly, since $g(x)$ is decreasing on $(3, 6)$, $f(x) = \\log_{0.6}(6x - x^2)$ will be increasing on $(3, 6)$.\n\nTherefore, the monotonic increasing interval of $f(x)$ is $(3, 6)$.

Let's start by determining the number of seeds in each bucket:\n   - Bucket B has 30 seeds.\n   - Bucket A has 10 more seeds than bucket B, so bucket A has \\(30 + 10 = 40\\) seeds.\n   - Since the total number of seeds in all buckets is 100, the number of seeds in bucket C is \\(100 - (40 + 30) = 30\\) seeds.\n\n2. The probability of selecting one of the first 10 seeds from bucket C when selecting a seed randomly from bucket C is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.

We are given that Mary wrote down all the divisors of a 4-digit even number \\( n \\) in increasing order, and at some point she wrote down 323 as a divisor of \\( n \\). We need to find the smallest possible value of the next divisor written to the right of 323.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the properties of 323\nThe number 323 can be factored into prime factors as \\( 323 = 17 \\times 19 \\). Since 323 is a divisor of \\( n \\), \\( n \\) must be divisible by 323.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the next divisor after 323\nThe next divisor of \\( n \\) after 323 must be the smallest number greater than 323 that divides \\( n \\). Since \\( n \\) is a 4-digit even number, we need to find the smallest number greater than 323 that is a divisor of \\( n \\).

The LCM of 323 and 324 is \\( 2^2 \\times 3^4 \\times 17 \\times 19 = 104748 \\), which is not a 4-digit number.\n- 330: \\( 330 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 11 \\). If \\( n \\) is divisible by 323 and 330, the LCM of 323 and 330 must divide \\( n \\).

If \\( n \\) is divisible by 323 and 340, the LCM of 323 and 340 must divide \\( n \\). The LCM of 323 and 340 is \\( 2^2 \\times 5 \\times 17 \\times 19 = 6460 \\), which is not a 4-digit number in the form of \\( n \\).\n- 361: \\( 361 = 19^2 \\). If \\( n \\) is divisible by 323 and 361, the LCM of 323 and 361 must divide \\( n \\). The LCM of 323 and 361 is \\( 17 \\times 19^2 = 6137 \\), which is not a 4-digit number.\n- 646: \\( 646 = 2 \\times 17 \\times 19 \\).
