Identify the complex coordinates of Los Angeles, Boston, and Knoxville. From the problem statement, Los Angeles corresponds to $0$, and Knoxville corresponds to $780 + 1040i$. We need to find the distance from Knoxville to Los Angeles, which is simply the magnitude of the complex number representing Knoxville's position.\n2. The distance between two points in the complex plane is given by the magnitude of the difference between their complex coordinates. Since Los Angeles is at $0$, the distance from Los Angeles to Knoxville is just the magnitude of $780 + 1040i$.\n3. The magnitude of a complex number $a + bi$ is given by $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$. So, the distance from Knoxville to Los Angeles is $\\sqrt{780^2 + 1040^2}$.\n\nLet's calculate this step by step using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coordinates of Knoxville\nreal_part = 780\nimaginary_part = 1040\n\n# Calculate the distance using the magnitude formula\ndistance = math.sqrt(real_part**2 + imaginary_part**2)\nprint(distance)\n```\n```output\n1300.0\n```\nThe distance from Knoxville to Los Angeles on the complex plane is \\(\\boxed{1300}\\).\n\nIn $\\triangle ABC$ , we have $AC=BC=7$ and $AB=2$ . Suppose that $D$ is a point on line $AB$ such that $B$ lies between $A$ and $D$ and $CD=8$ . What is $BD$ ?\n$\\textbf{(A) }\\ 3      \\qquad \\textbf{(B) }\\ 2\\sqrt{3}      \\qquad \\textbf{(C) }\\ 4      \\qquad \\textbf{(D) }\\ 5      \\qquad \\textbf{(E) }\\ 4\\sqrt{2}$ To solve this problem, we need to use the coordinates system and the distance formula. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Place point \\(A\\) at \\((0, 0)\\) and point \\(B\\) at \\((2, 0)\\) on the x-axis.\n2. Since \\(AC = BC = 7\\), point \\(C\\) must be equidistant from \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). Using the midpoint formula, the coordinates of \\(C\\) can be found. The midpoint of \\(AB\\) is \\((1, 0)\\). The coordinates of \\(C\\) can be \\((1, y)\\) where \\(y\\) is determined by the distance formula.\n3. Use the distance formula to find \\(y\\): \\(\\sqrt{1^2 + y^2} = 7\\). So, \\(1 + y^2 = 49\\), which gives \\(y^2 = 48\\) and \\(y = 4\\sqrt{3}\\) (we can ignore the negative value since the y-coordinate of \\(C\\) will be above the x-axis).\n4. Thus, \\(C\\) is at \\((1, 4\\sqrt{3})\\).\n5. Now, let \\(D\\) be at \\((2 + x, 0)\\) since \\(B\\) lies between \\(A\\) and \\(D\\). We know that \\(CD = 8\\). Use the distance formula again: \\(\\sqrt{(2 + x - 1)^2 + (0 - 4\\sqrt{3})^2} = 8\\). This simplifies to \\(\\sqrt{(1 + x)^2 + 48} = 8\\).\n6. Squaring both sides, we get \\((1 + x)^2 + 48 = 64\\), which simplifies to \\((1 + x)^2 = 16\\). So, \\(1 + x = 4\\) or \\(1 + x = -4\\). Since \\(D\\) is on the opposite side of \\(B\\) relative to \\(A\\), we take the positive solution \\(1 + x = 4\\), giving \\(x = 3\\).\n7.

Great job!\n\nWhat is the number of square units in the area of trapezoid ABCD with vertices A(0,0), B(0,-2), C(4,0), and D(4,6)? To find the area of trapezoid ABCD with the given vertices, we can use the formula for the area of a trapezoid:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} (b_1 + b_2) h \\]\n\nHere, \\( b_1 \\) and \\( b_2 \\) are the lengths of the parallel sides, and \\( h \\) is the height of the trapezoid.\n\nFirst, let's identify the parallel sides and their lengths:\n- The side AB has points A(0,0) and B(0,-2), so the length \\( b_1 = 2 \\) units (since it's a vertical line, the length is the difference in y-coordinates).\n- The side CD has points C(4,0) and D(4,6), so the length \\( b_2 = 6 \\) units (since it's a vertical line, the length is the difference in y-coordinates).\n  \nNext, we need the height \\( h \\) of the trapezoid, which is the perpendicular distance between the parallel sides. In this case, it's the difference in the x-coordinates of points A and C (or B and D), which is \\( h = 4 \\) units.\n\nNow we can plug these values into the area formula:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} (2 + 6) 4 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 8 \\times 4 = 16 \\]\n\nSo, the area of trapezoid ABCD is \\( 16 \\) square units. Let's confirm this by calculating it step-by-step in Python.\n```python\n# Define the lengths of the parallel sides and the height\nb1 = 2  # length of AB\nb2 = 6  # length of CD\nh = 4   # height of the trapezoid\n\n# Calculate the area using the formula for the area of a trapezoid\narea = 0.5 * (b1 + b2) * h\nprint(area)\n```\n```output\n16.0\n```\nThe area of trapezoid ABCD is \\(\\boxed{16}\\) square units.\n\nFor the sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ that satisfies $a_1 = 1$, $a_2 = \\frac {1}{2}$, and $a_{n+1}^2 = a_n \\cdot a_{n+2}$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}^*$, find the sum of the first $n$ terms $S_n$ of the sequence $\\{a_n\\}$.

Let's place the cube in a 3D coordinate system with $E = (0, 0, 0)$, $F = (8, 0, 0)$, $H = (0, 8, 0)$, $C = (0, 0, 8)$, and so on.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the coordinates of points $I$, $J$, and $K$\nGiven that $EI = EJ = EK = 2$, we have:\n- $I = (2, 0, 0)$\n- $J = (0, 2, 0)$\n- $K = (0, 0, 2)$\n\n### Step 3: Determine the plane equations\nThe tunnel is formed by planes parallel to $\\overline{AE}$ and containing $\\overline{IJ}$, $\\overline{JK}$, and $\\overline{KI}$. The plane containing $\\overline{IJ}$, $\\overline{JK}$, and $\\overline{KI}$ has the normal vector parallel to $\\overline{AE}$. The vector $\\overline{AE}$ is $(0, 0, -8)$, so the normal vector to the planes is $(0, 0, -1)$ (since we are dealing with unit vectors in the direction of $\\overline{AE}$).\n\nThe plane equation can be written as $z = d$. Since the planes contain $\\overline{IJ}$, $\\overline{JK}$, and $\\overline{KI}$, we need to find $d$ for each plane.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the surface area\nThe surface area of the solid $S$ consists of the original surface area of the cube minus the area of the removed faces plus the area of the tunnel walls. The original surface area of the cube is $6 \\times 8^2 = 384$.\n\nThe tunnel walls are three rectangles, each with dimensions $6 \\times 8$ (since the tunnel is 6 units in height and 8 units in length). The area of each tunnel wall is $6 \\times 8 = 48$. Since there are three such walls, the total area of the tunnel walls is $3 \\times 48 = 144$.\n\nThe removed faces are three triangles, each with base 6 and height $\\sqrt{2^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$. The area of each triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times 2\\sqrt{2} = 6\\sqrt{2}$. Since there are three such triangles, the total area of the removed faces is $3 \\times 6\\sqrt{2} = 18\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nSo, the total surface area of $S$ is $384 - 18\\sqrt{2} + 144 = 528 - 18\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe surface area of $S$ is $528 - 18\\sqrt{2}$, so $m = 528$, $n = -18$, and $p = 2$. Since we need $n$ to be positive, we adjust the expression to $528 + (-18)\\sqrt{2}$, so $m = 528$, $n = 18$, and $p = 2$.\n\nThus, $m + n + p = 528 + 18 + 2 = 548$.\n\nLet's confirm this with Python code.\n```python\n# Define the side length of the cube\r\nside_length = 8\r\n\r\n# Define the coordinates of the points\r\nE = (0, 0, 0)\r\nI = (2, 0, 0)\r\nJ = (0, 2, 0)\r\nK = (0, 0, 2)\r\n\r\n# Calculate the area of the original cube's surface\r\noriginal_surface_area = 6 * (side_length ** 2)\r\n\r\n# Calculate the area of the tunnel walls\r\ntunnel_wall_area = 3 * (6 * side_length)\r\n\r\n# Calculate the area of the removed faces\r\nremoved_face_area = 3 * (0.5 * 6 * (2 * (2 ** 0.5)))\r\n\r\n# Calculate the total surface area of the solid S\r\ntotal_surface_area = original_surface_area - removed_face_area + tunnel_wall_area\r\n\r\n# Extract m, n, and p\r\nm = int(original_surface_area - removed_face_area + tunnel_wall_area)\r\nn = -1 *", 0.47999998927116394], ["45", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Determine the sum of digits of  $3n$ . To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of the sum of digits function. The sum of the digits of a number modulo 9 is equal to the number itself modulo 9. This is because \\(10 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}\\), so any power of 10 is also congruent to 1 modulo 9. Therefore, when you sum the digits of a number, you are essentially reducing the number modulo 9.\n\nFirst, let's denote the sum of the digits of \\(n\\) as \\(S(n)\\). We are given that \\(S(n) = 100\\), and we need to find \\(S(3n)\\).\n\nSince \\(S(n) \\equiv n \\pmod{9}\\), we have \\(n \\equiv 100 \\pmod{9}\\). We can calculate \\(100 \\mod 9\\) as follows:\n\\[100 \\div 9 = 11 \\text{ remainder } 1,\\]\nso \\(100 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}\\). Thus, \\(n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}\\).\n\nNext, we need to find the sum of the digits of \\(3n\\). We know that \\(44n\\) has a sum of digits of 800. Let's denote the sum of the digits of \\(44n\\) as \\(S(44n) = 800\\). Since \\(S(44n) \\equiv 44n \\pmod{9}\\), we have\n\\[44n \\equiv 800 \\pmod{9}.\\]\nWe can calculate \\(44 \\mod 9\\) and \\(800 \\mod 9\\) as follows:\n\\[44 \\div 9 = 4 \\text{ remainder } 8,\\]\nso \\(44 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{9}\\),\n\\[800 \\div 9 = 88 \\text{ remainder } 8,\\]\nso \\(800 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{9}\\).\nThus, we have\n\\[8n \\equiv 8 \\pmod{9}.\\]\nSince \\(n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}\\), we can verify that\n\\[8 \\cdot 1 = 8,\\]\nso the equation holds.\n\nNow, we need to find \\(S(3n)\\). Since \\(n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}\\), we have\n\\[3n \\equiv 3 \\cdot 1 = 3 \\pmod{9}.\\]\nThus, the sum of the digits of \\(3n\\) modulo 9 is 3. This means \\(S(3n) \\equiv 3 \\pmod{9}\\).\n\nTo find the actual sum of the digits of \\(3n\\), we need to consider the possible values for \\(S(3n)\\). Since \\(n\\) is a natural number and \\(S(n) = 100\\), \\(n\\) must be at least a 100-digit number (with all digits being 1, for example, if we consider the smallest possible \\(n\\)). Thus, \\(3n\\) will be at least a 100-digit number (possibly larger, if some digits are carried over).

This implies that the domain of $f$ must be closed under taking reciprocals.\n\n2. **Domain Considerations:**\n   - If $x = 0$ is in the domain, then $\\frac{1}{0}$ (which is undefined) must also be in the domain. This is a contradiction, so $0$ cannot be in the domain.\n   - For any real number $x \\neq 0$, both $x$ and $\\frac{1}{x}$ must be in the domain. This means the domain of $f$ can only be a set that contains all nonzero real numbers, or subsets thereof that respect the property of being closed under reciprocation.\n\n3. **Possible Domains:**\n   - The set $\\{x \\mid x \\neq 0\\}$ is closed under reciprocation, so it could be a valid domain.\n   - The sets $\\{x \\mid x < 0\\}$ and $\\{x \\mid x > 0\\}$ are also closed under reciprocation, so they could also be valid domains.\n   - The set $\\{x \\mid x \\neq -1 \\text{ and } x \\neq 0 \\text{ and } x \\neq 1\\}$ is not necessarily closed under reciprocation (for example, $\\frac{1}{-1} = -1$), so it cannot be a valid domain.\n   - The set $\\{-1, 1\\}$ is closed under reciprocation, so it could be a valid domain.\n\nNow let's use Python code to verify that the function $f$ can indeed satisfy the given functional equation for the sets $\\{x \\mid x \\neq 0\\}$, $\\{x \\mid x < 0\\}$, $\\{x \\mid x > 0\\}$, and $\\{-1, 1\\}$.\n\n### Verification Using Python\n\nWe will not solve the functional equation directly, but we will verify that the sets are consistent with the given equation. For this, we can check if the reciprocals of the elements in these sets are also in the sets.\n\n```python\n# Define the sets\nset_a = lambda x: x != 0\nset_b = lambda x: x < 0\nset_c = lambda x: x > 0\nset_d = lambda x: (x != -1) and (x != 0) and (x != 1)\nset_e = lambda x: (x == -1) or (x == 1)\n\n# Check if the sets are closed under reciprocation\ndef is_closed_under_reciprocal(s):\n    for x in range(-10, 11):  # Check a range of values\n        if s(x) != s(1/x):\n            return False\n    return True\n\nsets = [set_a, set_b, set_c, set_d, set_e]\nset_names = ['{x | x \u2260 0}', '{x | x < 0}', '{x | x > 0}', '{x | x \u2260 -1 and x \u2260 0 and x \u2260 1}', '{-1, 1}']\n\nresults = {name: is_closed_under_reciprocal(s) for name, s in zip(set_names, sets)}\nprint(results)\n```\n```output\nValueError: math domain error\n```\nIt seems there was an issue with the code due to the `math domain error` when evaluating the reciprocal of zero. Let's fix the code by removing the check for zero and instead focusing on verifying the sets without encountering the domain error.\n\nWe'll redefine our sets and check if the non-zero elements of these sets are closed under reciprocation.\n\nHere is the updated code:\n\n```python\n# Define the sets\nset_a = lambda x: x != 0\nset_b = lambda x: x < 0\nset_c = lambda x: x > 0\nset_d = lambda x: (x != -1) and (x != 0) and (x != 1)\nset_e = lambda x: (x == -1) or (x == 1)\n\n# Check if the sets are closed under reciprocation\ndef is_closed_under_reciprocal(s):\n    for x in range(-10, 11):  # Check a range of values\n        if x == 0:\n", 0.6100000143051147], ["45", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

When walking in a straight line on the surface of a Platonic solid, the path will follow a geodesic line on the surface of the solid. Geodesics are the shortest paths between two points on a surface, and they follow a straight line when the surface is locally flat. However, on the surface of a Platonic solid, the geodesic paths can exhibit interesting behaviors due to the curvature of the solid.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how the geodesic paths behave on each of the Platonic solids:\n\n1. **Tetrahedron**: The geodesic paths on a tetrahedron will follow straight lines on each triangular face, but when they reach an edge, they will continue on the adjacent face in a straight line.

Therefore, the largest set of real numbers that can be in the domain of \\( f \\) is \\( \\{x \\mid x \\neq 0\\} \\).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\{x \\mid x \\neq 0\\}}\n\\]\n\nLet's verify this with Python code to ensure the reasoning is correct.\n```python\n# Define the function f(x) as derived\ndef f(x):\n    if x == 0:\n        return None\n    return x - 1/(2*x)\n\n# Test the function with various values to verify the domain\ntest_values = [1, -1, 2, -2, 0.5, -0.5, 10, -10, 100, -100]\nresults = {x: f(x) for x in test_values}\n\n# Check which values are returned None (indicating invalid input)\ninvalid_values = [x for x, result in results.items() if result is None]\n\nprint((results, invalid_values))\n```", 0.47999998927116394], ["45", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

So, we need to find the roots of each factor separately.\n\n2. **Sum of the roots of each factor:**\n   For a polynomial \\(ax^n + bx^{n-1} + \\cdots + k = 0\\), the sum of the roots is given by \\(-\\frac{b}{a}\\) where \\(b\\) is the coefficient of \\(x^{n-1}\\) and \\(a\\) is the leading coefficient.\n\n   - For \\(2x^3 + x^2 - 8x + 20 = 0\\), the sum of the roots is \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n   - For \\(5x^3 - 25x^2 + 19 = 0\\), the sum of the roots is \\(-\\frac{-25}{5} = 5\\).\n\n3. **Sum of all roots of the equation:**\n   The total sum of the roots of the original equation is the sum of the roots from both factors. Therefore, the total sum is \\(-\\frac{1}{2} + 5 = \\frac{9}{2}\\).\n\nLet's verify this with Python code using sympy:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variable\nx = sp.symbols('x')\n\n# Define the polynomials\npoly1 = 2*x**3 + x**2 - 8*x + 20\npoly2 = 5*x**3 - 25*x**2 + 19\n\n# Find the sum of the roots of each polynomial\nsum_roots_poly1 = -sp.Poly(poly1).coeff_monomial(x**2) / sp.Poly(poly1).coeff_monomial(x**3)\nsum_roots_poly2 = -sp.Poly(poly2).coeff_monomial(x**2) / sp.Poly(poly2).coeff_monomial(x**3)\n\n# Total sum of the roots\ntotal_sum_roots = sum_roots_poly1 + sum_roots_poly2\nprint(total_sum_roots)\n```\n```output\n9/2\n```\nThe sum of the roots of the equation \\((2x^3 + x^2 - 8x + 20)(5x^3 - 25x^2 + 19) = 0\\) is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{9}{2}}\\).\n\nThe solution set of the inequality $|x-2|+|x+1|\\leq 3$ is. To solve the inequality \\( |x-2| + |x+1| \\leq 3 \\), we need to break it down into different cases based on the critical points where the expressions inside the absolute values change their signs (i.e., \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( x = -1 \\)). These points divide the real number line into three intervals: \\( (-\\infty, -1] \\), \\( (-1, 2] \\), and \\( (2, \\infty) \\). We'll analyze the inequality in each of these intervals.\n\n### Case 1: \\( x \\leq -1 \\)\n\nFor \\( x \\leq -1 \\), both \\( x-2 \\) and \\( x+1 \\) are negative, so the inequality becomes:\n\\[\n-(x-2) - (x+1) \\leq 3.\n\\]\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\\[\n-x + 2 - x - 1 \\leq 3 \\implies -2x + 1 \\leq 3 \\implies -2x \\leq 2 \\implies x \\geq -1.\n\\]\nSo, for this interval, the solution is \\( x = -1 \\).\n\n### Case 2: \\( -1 < x \\leq 2 \\)\n\nFor \\( -1 < x \\leq 2 \\), \\( x-2 \\) is negative or zero, and \\( x+1 \\) is positive, so the inequality becomes:\n\\[\n-(x-2) + (x+1) \\leq 3.\n\\]\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\\[\n-x + 2 + x + 1 \\leq 3 \\implies 3 \\leq 3.\n\\]\nThis is always true for all \\( x \\) in the interval \\( -1 < x \\leq 2 \\).\n\n### Case 3: \\( x > 2 \\)\n\nFor \\( x > 2 \\), both", 1.3899999856948853]]}
