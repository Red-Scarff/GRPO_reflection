To find the number of positive integers that satisfy the given conditions, we need to consider the constraints carefully. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Problem\nWe need to find the number of positive integers where:\n1. Each digit is either 1, 2, or 3.\n2. The sum of the digits is 10.\n\n### Step 2: Represent the Problem Mathematically\nLet \\( x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n \\) be the digits of the number. Each \\( x_i \\) can be 1, 2, or 3, and the sum of these digits must be 10:\n\\[\nx_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_n = 10\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Use Generating Functions\nTo solve this problem, we can use generating functions. The generating function for each digit \\( x_i \\) (which can be 1, 2, or 3) is:\n\\[\nG(x) = x + x^2 + x^3\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the Coefficient of \\( x^{10} \\)\nWe need to find the coefficient of \\( x^{10} \\) in the expansion of \\( G(x)^n \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of digits. The generating function for \\( n \\) digits is:\n\\[\nG(x)^n = (x + x^2 + x^3)^n\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Simplify the Generating Function\nWe can simplify \\( G(x) \\) as follows:\n\\[\nG(x) = x(1 + x + x^2)\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Use the Binomial Theorem\nWe need to find the coefficient of \\( x^{10} \\) in the expansion of \\( (x(1 + x + x^2))^n \\):\n\\[\n(x(1 + x + x^2))^n = x^n (1 + x + x^2)^n\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Expand \\( (1 + x + x^2)^n \\)\nWe need to expand \\( (1 + x + x^2)^n \\) and find the coefficient of \\( x^{10-n} \\) in the expansion. This can be done using the multinomial theorem, but it is more practical to use combinatorial methods.\n\n### Step 8: Use Combinatorial Methods\nWe need to count the number of solutions to the equation:\n\\[\ny_1 + y_2 + \\cdots + y_n = 10 - n\n\\]\nwhere \\( y_i = x_i - 1 \\) and \\( y_i \\) can be 0, 1, or 2 (since \\( x_i \\) can be 1, 2, or 3).\n\n### Step 9: Use the Stars and Bars Method\nThe number of non-negative integer solutions to \\( y_1 + y_2 + \\cdots + y_n = 10 - n \\) is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n", 1.559999942779541], ["40", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

This is a classic problem in combinatorics involving the use of Burnside's Lemma.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Symmetries**: The symmetries of a five-pointed star include 5 rotations (0\u00b0, 72\u00b0, 144\u00b0, 216\u00b0, 288\u00b0) and 5 reflections (across axes passing through the center and a point or the midpoint of an opposite segment).

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify the Coordinates of Points**: Let's assume \\(A = (0, 0)\\), \\(B = (25, 0)\\), \\(D = (0, h)\\), and \\(C = (25, h)\\). The point \\(E\\) is on \\(AB\\) at \\((8, 0)\\), and the point \\(F\\) is on \\(CD\\) at \\((22, h)\\). Since \\(B'\\) is the reflection of \\(B\\) over the crease \\(EF\\), the coordinates of \\(B'\\) will be symmetric with respect to \\(EF\\).\n\n2. **Find the Coordinates of \\(B'\\)**: Since \\(B = (25, 0)\\) and \\(E = (8, 0)\\), the vertical distance from \\(B\\) to \\(EF\\) is the same as the vertical distance from \\(B'\\) to \\(EF\\). The midpoint of \\(BB'\\) lies on \\(EF\\). Let's denote the coordinates of \\(B'\\) as \\((x', y')\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Midpoint of \\(BB'\\)**: The midpoint of \\(BB'\\) is \\(\\left(\\frac{25 + x'}{2}, \\frac{0 + y'}{2}\\right)\\). This midpoint must lie on the line \\(EF\\), which has the equation \\(y = \\frac{h}{14}x\\). So, \\(\\frac{y'}{2} = \\frac{h}{14} \\cdot \\frac{25 + x'}{2}\\), or \\(y' = \\frac{h}{7}(25 + x')\\).\n\n4. **Distance Calculation**: The distance from \\(B\\) to \\(EF\\) is the same as the distance from \\(B'\\) to \\(EF\\). The perpendicular distance from a point \\((x_1, y_1)\\) to a line \\(ax + by + c = 0\\) is given by \\(\\frac{|ax_1 + by_1 + c|}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}\\). For the line \\(y = \\frac{h}{14}x\\), or \\(hx - 14y = 0\\), the distance from \\(B = (25, 0)\\) to the line is \\(\\frac{|25h|}{\\sqrt{h^2 + 196}}\\). Similarly, the distance from \\(B' = (x', \\frac{h}{7}(25 + x'))\\) to the line is \\(\\frac{|hx' - 14 \\cdot \\frac{h}{7}(25 + x')|}{\\sqrt{h^2 + 196}} = \\frac{|hx' - 2h(25 + x')|}{\\sqrt{h^2 + 196}} = \\frac{|-h(50 + x')|}{\\sqrt{h^2 + 196}}\\).\n\n5. **Equate the Distances**: Since the distances are equal, we have \\(\\frac{|25h|}{\\sqrt{h^2 + 196}} = \\frac{|-h(50 + x')|}{\\sqrt{h^2 + 196}}\\). Simplifying, we get \\(25 = 50 + x'\\), so \\(x' = -25\\). This means \\(B' = (-25, \\frac{h}{7} \\cdot 0) = (-25, 0)\\), but this is not possible because it must be inside the rectangle.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the coordinates of \\(B'\\). The correct approach is to consider the reflection over the line \\(EF\\). The correct coordinates of \\(B'\\) are \\((25 - 2(25 - 22), 2 \\cdot \\frac{h}{7} \\cdot 25) = (9, \\frac{50h}{7})\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the height \\(h\\) of the rectangle. The distance from \\(B\\) to \\(E\\) is 17, and the distance from \\(B'\\) to \\(F\\) must also be 17. Since \\(B' = (9, \\frac{50h}{7})\\) and \\(F = (22, h)\\), the vertical distance is \\(h - \\frac{50h}{7} = \\frac{7h - 50h}{7} = \\frac{-43h}{7}\\).
