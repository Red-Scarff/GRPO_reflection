In particular, $d$ must divide $2n(n+1) - 2n(n-1) = 4n$. Therefore, $d$ must be a divisor of $4n$.

The sides of the triangle are $AB = 13$, $BC = 14$, and $CA = 15$. We need to find the distance from the center $O$ of the sphere to the plane of the triangle $ABC$.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Area of Triangle $ABC$\nWe can use Heron's formula to calculate the area of the triangle. The semi-perimeter $s$ is given by:\n\\[ s = \\frac{AB + BC + CA}{2} = \\frac{13 + 14 + 15}{2} = 21. \\]\nThe area $K$ of the triangle is:\n\\[ K = \\sqrt{s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - CA)} = \\sqrt{21 \\cdot (21 - 13) \\cdot (21 - 14) \\cdot (21 - 15)} = \\sqrt{21 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6} = 84. \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Circumradius of Triangle $ABC$\nThe circumradius $R$ of the triangle is given by:\n\\[ R = \\frac{AB \\cdot BC \\cdot CA}{4K} = \\frac{13 \\cdot 14 \\cdot 15}{4 \\cdot 84} = \\frac{2730}{336} = \\frac{65}{8}. \\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Distance from $O$ to the Plane of $ABC$\nThe distance $d$ from the center $O$ of the sphere to the plane of the triangle $ABC$ can be found using the formula:\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{R^2 - \\left(\\frac{ABC}{4K}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{20^2 - \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{21 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6}}{20}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{400 - \\left(\\frac{84}{20}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{400 - \\left(\\frac{21}{5}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{400 - \\left(\\frac{441}{25}\\right)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{10000 - 441}{25}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{9559}{25}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{9559}}{5}. \\]\n\n### Step 5: Simplify the Answer\nThe distance $d$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{9559}}{5}$. Here, $m = 1$, $n = 9559$, and $k = 5$. Since $9559$ is not divisible by the square of any prime and $1$ and $5$ are relatively prime, we can directly add these values.\n\nThus, $m + n + k = 1 + 9559 + 5 = 9565$. Let's confirm this with Python and SymPy:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Given values\nR = 20\nK = 84\n\n# Calculate the distance from the center O to the plane of ABC\nd = sp.sqrt(R**2 - (K/(4*R))**2)\n\n# Extract m, n, k from the simplified form of d\nnumerator = sp.simplify(d**2)\nm, n = sp.fraction(numerator)\nk = sp.denom(numerator)\n\n# Calculate m + n + k\nresult = m + n + k\nprint(result)\n```\n```output\n9559\n```\nIt seems I made an error in interpreting the initial problem statement and the simplified form of the distance. The correct distance should be expressed in terms of $m$, $n$, and $k$ such that the form is consistent with the problem's constraints. Given the output $9559$, it appears that the distance should indeed be expressed as $\\frac{\\sqrt{9559}}{5}$, but this doesn't align with the expected form for $m$, $n$, and $k$.\n\nLet's revisit the problem and ensure we correctly interpret the constraints and calculations:\n\n1. The radius of the sphere is $20$.\n2. The sides of the triangle are $AB = 13$, $BC = 14$, and $CA = 15$.\n3. The area $K$ of the triangle is $84$.\n4.

Each wing is shaped like a right triangle with one leg measuring 3 inches, another leg measuring 4 inches, and the hypotenuse measuring 5 inches. Tommy wants to know the total area of the three wings combined. How much area will Tommy need to cut out for all three wings?\nTo find the total area of the three triangular wings, we first need to calculate the area of one triangular wing and then multiply it by three. The area of a right triangle is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\]\n\nFor each wing, the base and height are 3 inches and 4 inches, respectively. So, the area of one wing is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area of one wing} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 4 = 6 \\text{ square inches} \\]\n\nSince there are three wings, the total area is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total area} = 3 \\times 6 = 18 \\text{ square inches} \\]\n\nLet's confirm this with Python code.\n```python\n# Define the dimensions of the triangle\nbase = 3\nheight = 4\n\n# Calculate the area of one triangular wing\narea_one_wing = 0.5 * base * height\n\n# Calculate the total area for three wings\ntotal_area = 3 * area_one_wing\nprint(total_area)\n```\n```output\n18.0\n```\nThe total area that Tommy needs to cut out for all three wings is \\(\\boxed{18}\\) square inches.\n\nConsider a finite degree morphism $f: X \\to Y$ between two smooth projective curves $X$ and $Y$ over the complex field, where $f$ is a non-constant rational map.

If $a = 1$, then $b = 3$.\n\\[\n1^4 = 1 \\implies 47 - 2x = 1 \\implies 2x = 47 - 1 = 46 \\implies x = 23.\n\\]\n\\[\n3^4 = 81 \\implies 35 + 2(23) = 35 + 46 = 81.\n\\]\nBoth conditions are satisfied, so $x = 23$ is a solution.\n\nThus, the solutions to the equation are $x = -17$ and $x = 23$. We should verify that there are no other solutions by solving the polynomial equation.
