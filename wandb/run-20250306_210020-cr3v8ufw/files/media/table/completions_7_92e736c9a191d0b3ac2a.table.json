We need to sum the complex numbers in the form $\\text{cis } \\theta$, which is equivalent to $e^{i\\theta}$.

The last term is $147^\\circ$.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of terms in the sequence. The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:\n\\[a_n = a + (n-1)d\\]\nSo, for the last term $147^\\circ$:\n\\[147 = 75 + (n-1) \\cdot 8\\]\nSolving for $n$:\n\\[147 = 75 + 8(n-1)\\]\n\\[72 = 8(n-1)\\]\n\\[n-1 = 9\\]\n\\[n = 10\\]\nSo, there are 10 terms in the sequence.\n\nNext, we need to find the sum of the complex numbers.

The word \"MATHEMATICS\" contains the following letters:\n\n- Vowels: A, A, E, I\n- Consonants: M, M, T, T, H, C, S\n\nWe need to determine the number of distinct collections of 2 vowels and 4 consonants. To do this, we can use combinatorics to count the number of ways to choose 2 vowels from 4 and 4 consonants from 7, taking into account the indistinguishability of the repeated letters.\n\nLet's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Count the distinct ways to choose 2 vowels from A, A, E, I:**\n   - We can choose 2 vowels in the following ways:\n     - Both vowels are A (1 way)\n     - One vowel is A and the other is E or I (2 ways, A + E, A + I)\n   - So there are 3 distinct ways to choose 2 vowels.\n\n2. **Count the distinct ways to choose 4 consonants from M, M, T, T, H, C, S:**\n   - We need to consider all possible combinations of 4 consonants and ensure we don't overcount due to indistinguishable letters.\n   - The possible combinations are:\n     - Two M's and two T's: (1 way)\n     - Two M's and two other consonants: (2 ways, MM + H, MM + C)\n     - Two M's and one T and one other consonant: (4 ways, MM + H + C, MM + H + S, MM + C + S)\n     - Two M's and two other consonants: (2 ways, MM + T + H, MM + T + C)\n     - Two T's and two other consonants: (2 ways, TT + H + C, TT + H + S)\n     - Two T's and one M and one other consonant: (2 ways, TT + M + H, TT + M + C)\n     - Two T's and two other consonants: (1 way, TT + H + C)\n     - Four other consonants: (1 way, H + C + S + M)\n   - So there are 8 distinct ways to choose 4 consonants.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of distinct collections:**\n   - The total number of distinct collections is the product of the number of ways to choose the vowels and the number of ways to choose the consonants.\n   - Total distinct collections = 3 (vowels) * 8 (consonants) = 24.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the indistinguishability of the letters and ensure we do not overcount. Let's use Python to verify the distinct collections:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Define the letters\nvowels = ['A', 'A', 'E', 'I']\nconsonants = ['M', 'M', 'T', 'T', 'H', 'C', 'S']\n\n# Function to get distinct combinations\ndef distinct_combinations(elements, k):\n    return set(itertools.combinations(elements, k))\n\n# Get distinct combinations for vowels and consonants\ndistinct_vowel_combinations = distinct_combinations(vowels, 2)\ndistinct_consonant_combinations = distinct_combinations(consonants, 4)\n\n# Calculate the total number of distinct collections\ntotal_distinct_collections = len(distinct_vowel_combinations) * len(distinct_consonant_combinations)\nprint(total_distinct_collections)\n```\n```output\n40\n```\nIt seems that our initial reasoning led to an overcounting issue.

Thus, the number of people who will end up with fewer than 7 cards is 2.\n\nHere's the Python code to confirm this:\n\n```python\n# Define the total number of cards and people\ntotal_cards = 52\ntotal_people = 8\n\n# Calculate the number of cards each person will get\ncards_per_person = total_cards // total_people\nextra_cards = total_cards % total_people\n\n# The number of people who will get fewer than 7 cards is the number of people who get the extra cards\npeople_with_fewer_than_7_cards = extra_cards\n\n# Print the result\nprint(people_with_fewer_than_7_cards)\n```\n```output\n4\n```\nIt seems there was an error in the initial reasoning or the Python code execution. Let's re-evaluate the problem.\n\nWe need to deal 52 cards to 8 people. Each person will get \\(\\lfloor 52 / 8 \\rfloor = 6\\) cards. This leaves us with \\(52 - 8 \\times 6 = 4\\) cards that need to be distributed among the 8 people.\n\nThe 4 remaining cards will be distributed one by one to the first 4 people, while the first 6 people will still have 6 cards each.\n\nSo the first 4 people will have 6 cards each, and the remaining 4 people will have 7 cards each. This means the people who have fewer than 7 cards are the first 4 people.\n\nLet's correct the code to reflect this understanding and re-run the calculation:\n\n```python\n# Define the total number of cards and people\ntotal_cards = 52\ntotal_people = 8\n\n# Calculate the number of cards each person will get\ncards_per_person = total_cards // total_people\nextra_cards = total_cards % total_people\n\n# The number of people who will get fewer than 7 cards is the number of people who don't get the extra cards\npeople_with_fewer_than_7_cards = total_people - extra_cards\n\n# Print the result\nprint(people_with_fewer_than_7_cards)\n```\n```output\n4\n```\nThe output confirms that the number of people who will end up with fewer than 7 cards is indeed 4.

By trying different permutations, we notice that any permutation where the terms are in increasing or decreasing order results in the same maximum value. There are $5!$ (factorial) permutations of $(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)$, but since we have overcounted each \"correct\" arrangement multiple times due to their symmetry, we must divide by the number of ways each correct arrangement can be viewed. This number is $2$ for each arrangement (for example, $(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)$ and $(5, 4, 3, 2, 1)$ are each counted twice), so we divide by $2$ to correct this overcounting.

This means the sales volume decreases by 2 shirts per day for every dollar increase in price.\n3. **Expression for Sales Volume:** If the price of each shirt is increased by $x$, then the sales volume $y$ will be reduced by $2x$.

You want to ensure that your students understand the concept by using real-world examples. You decide to create a lesson plan that includes an activity where students can collect data and create their own lines of best fit. The activity will involve students measuring the height and arm span of their classmates and plotting the data on a scatter plot. The students will then be asked to draw a line of best fit through the data and discuss the correlation between the variables. Intuitively, the answer is: Yes, you can draw a line of best fit through the scatter plot data provided by your students. The line of best fit is the line that best represents the trend in the data. It is the line that minimizes the distance between itself and the data points. By drawing a line of best fit, students can see how much the data varies from the line and how closely the data points align with the line. This helps them understand the concept of correlation and how it can be used to make predictions.\n*</think>\n\nThe answer is: f(x)=x\u00b3-3x+2 is a polynomial function.

So we need to find:\n\\[ -1005 \\mod 2010. \\]\n\nSince \\(-1005\\) is negative, we can add 2010 to \\(-1005\\) to get a positive equivalent:\n\\[ -1005 + 2010 = 1005. \\]\n\nTherefore, the residue of \\(S\\) modulo 2010 is \\(1005\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1005} \\]\n\nLet's confirm this with Python code to ensure accuracy.\n```python\n# Calculate the sum S\nS = sum(i * (-1)**(i + 1) for i in range(1, 2011))\n\n# Calculate the residue of S modulo 2010\nresidue = S % 2010\nprint(residue)\n```", 1.3899999856948853]]}
