Next, we can interchange the order of summation. To do this, we need to determine the range of the summation variables. For each fixed $k$, $n$ ranges from $k+1$ to $\\infty$.

The triangle inequality theorem states that for any triangle with sides \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\):\n\n\\[a + b > c\\]\n\\[a + c > b\\]\n\\[b + c > a\\]\n\nIn our case, let's denote the unknown side length as \\(x\\), and the known sides as 6 and 3. So, the inequalities become:\n\n\\[6 + 3 > x \\implies 9 > x \\text{ or } x < 9\\]\n\\[6 + x > 3 \\implies x > -3 \\text{ (which is trivially true since x is a positive integer)}\\]\n\\[3 + x > 6 \\implies x > 3\\]\n\nCombining the valid inequalities, we get:\n\n\\[3 < x < 9\\]\n\nSince \\(x\\) must be an integer, the possible values for \\(x\\) are \\(4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\). Therefore, there are 5 possible integer side lengths.\n\nWe can write a Python code to verify this reasoning and count the possible integer side lengths.\n```python\n# Define the range of possible side lengths based on the inequalities\npossible_sides = [x for x in range(4, 9)]\n\n# The number of possible side lengths\nnumber_of_possible_sides = len(possible_sides)\nprint((possible_sides, number_of_possible_sides))\n```\n```output\n([4, 5, 6, 7, 8], 5)\n```\nThe possible integer side lengths that can complete the triangle are \\(4, 5, 6, 7,\\) and \\(8\\).

Determine the smallest positive value of \\(z\\).\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Values of \\(x\\)\n\nThe equation \\(\\cos(x) = 0\\) implies \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + k\\pi\\) for any integer \\(k\\).\n\n### Step 2: Find Corresponding Values of \\(z\\)\n\nWe need to solve \\(\\cos(x + z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\). For \\(\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}\\), the solutions are \\(\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{3} + 2m\\pi\\) or \\(\\theta = -\\frac{\\pi}{3} + 2m\\pi\\) for any integer \\(m\\).\n\nFor \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + k\\pi\\):\n- \\(\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + k\\pi + z\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\nThis implies:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\pi}{2} + k\\pi + z = \\frac{\\pi}{3} + 2m\\pi \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\frac{\\pi}{2} + k\\pi + z = -\\frac{\\pi}{3} + 2m\\pi\n\\]\n\nLet's solve these equations for \\(z\\):\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{\\pi}{3} - \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + k\\pi\\right) - 2m\\pi \\quad \\text{or} \\quad z = -\\frac{\\pi}{3} - \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + k\\pi\\right) + 2m\\pi\n\\]\n\nSimplifying these expressions:\n\n\\[\nz = -\\frac{\\pi}{6} - k\\pi - 2m\\pi \\quad \\text{or} \\quad z = -\\frac{5\\pi}{6} - k\\pi + 2m\\pi\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Smallest Positive Value of \\(z\\)\n\nWe need the smallest positive value of \\(z\\). Let's consider the first expression \\(z = -\\frac{\\pi}{6} - k\\pi - 2m\\pi\\). This expression can be positive when \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) are chosen appropriately. Setting \\(k = -1\\) and \\(m = 0\\) gives:\n\n\\[\nz = -\\frac{\\pi}{6} + \\pi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to check if this value is indeed the smallest positive value. We also need to check the second expression, \\(z = -\\frac{5\\pi}{6} - k\\pi + 2m\\pi\\). For \\(k = -1\\) and \\(m = 1\\):\n\n\\[\nz = -\\frac{5\\pi}{6} + \\pi + 2\\pi = \\frac{13\\pi}{6}\n\\]\n\nThis value is larger than \\(\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\). Therefore, the smallest positive value of \\(z\\) is \\(\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{5\\pi}{6}}\n\\]\n\nLet's verify this using Python code to ensure the result is accurate.\n```python\nimport math\r\n\r\n# Define the angle x for which cos(x) = 0\r\nx = math.pi / 2\r\n\r\n# Check the possible values of z that satisfy cos(x + z) = 1/2\r\n# We need to solve for z in the equations:\r\n# x + z = pi/3 + 2m*pi\r\n# x + z = -pi/3 + 2m*pi\r\n\r\n# First equation: z = pi/3 - (pi/2 + k*pi) - 2m*pi\r\n# Simplifying: z = -pi/6 - k*pi - 2m*pi\r\n\r\n# Second equation: z = -pi/3 - (pi/2 + k*pi) + 2m*pi\r\n# Simplifying: z = -5*pi/6 - k*pi + 2m*pi\r\n\r\n# Let's calculate the smallest positive z for both cases\r\nk = -1\r\nm = 0\r\nz1 = -math", 0.5], ["25", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

The product of the roots, $\\alpha \\beta \\gamma$, is given by:\n\n$$\\alpha \\beta \\gamma = -\\frac{d}{a}$$\n\nFor the polynomial $x^3 - 3x^2 + 4 = 0$, we have $a = 1$ and $d = 4$. Therefore:\n\n$$\\alpha \\beta \\gamma = -\\frac{4}{1} = -4$$\n\nNow, to find the product of the roots taken two at a time, we use the relation:\n\n$$\\alpha \\beta + \\beta \\gamma + \\gamma \\alpha = \\frac{c}{a}$$\n\nFor the polynomial $x^3 - 3x^2 + 4 = 0$, we have $a = 1$ and $c = 0$.

Let $X$ be the real line $\\mathbb{R}$ equipped with the standard metric. Consider the function $\\phi: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by the formula $\\phi(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cos(\\pi x)$. Show that the sequence $(x_1, x_2, \\ldots)$ defined by $x_{n+1} = \\phi(x_n)$ with any starting point $x_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a Cauchy sequence.\nTo show that the sequence $(x_1, x_2, \\ldots)$ defined by $x_{n+1} = \\phi(x_n)$ with any starting point $x_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a Cauchy sequence, we need to demonstrate that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists an integer $N$ such that for all $m, n > N$, we have $|x_m - x_n| < \\epsilon$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the function $\\phi(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cos(\\pi x)$. We need to show that the sequence generated by iterating this function is a Cauchy sequence. To do this, we will use the fact that $\\phi$ is a contraction mapping.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Check if $\\phi$ is a contraction mapping:**\n   A function $\\phi$ is a contraction mapping if there exists a constant $k$ with $0 \\leq k < 1$ such that $|\\phi(x) - \\phi(y)| \\leq k|x - y|$ for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n   Let's compute $|\\phi(x) - \\phi(y)|$:\n   \\[\n   |\\phi(x) - \\phi(y)| = \\left|\\frac{1}{2} \\cos(\\pi x) - \\frac{1}{2} \\cos(\\pi y)\\right| = \\frac{1}{2} |\\cos(\\pi x) - \\cos(\\pi y)|.\n   \\]\n   Using the trigonometric identity $|\\cos(\\pi x) - \\cos(\\pi y)| \\leq |\\pi(x - y)|$, we get:\n   \\[\n   |\\phi(x) - \\phi(y)| \\leq \\frac{1}{2} |\\pi(x - y)| = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi |x - y|.\n   \\]\n   Since $\\frac{1}{2} \\pi < 1$, $\\phi$ is indeed a contraction mapping with $k = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi$.\n\n2. **Apply Banach's Fixed-Point Theorem:**\n   By Banach's Fixed-Point Theorem, any contraction mapping on a complete metric space has a unique fixed point, and the sequence generated by iterating the function converges to this fixed point.
