So, we can write the parametric form as:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} t \\\\ \\frac{3t - 5}{4} \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nWe know that the distance between \\(\\begin{pmatrix} t \\\\ \\frac{3t - 5}{4} \\end{pmatrix}\\) and \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) is \\(t\\).

It is not, since \\(4 = 2^2\\) and no integer cubed equals 4.\n\nSince 22 does not meet the criteria, we need to check if there are any other two-digit even multiples of 11 that meet the criteria.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n1. **Identify the Dimensions of the Larger Rectangle:**\n   - The larger rectangle has a length of \\(10 + 2 + 2 = 14\\) inches and a width of \\(8 + 4 = 12\\) inches.\n   - The area of the larger rectangle is \\(14 \\times 12 = 168\\) square inches.\n\n2. **Identify the Dimensions of the Shaded Region:**\n   - The shaded region forms a shape inside the larger rectangle.

By examining the coordinates, we can see that the non-shaded region has a length of \\(10 + 2 = 12\\) inches and a width of \\(8 - 3 = 5\\) inches.\n   - The perimeter of the non-shaded region is the sum of all its sides.

If 75% of one square is overlapped by another square, and each overlapping region is divided by the bisector into two equal parts, how much is the shaded region's percentage of the total area?\nTo solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We'll assume that the squares are of the same size and that the overlapping regions are divided into two equal parts by a bisector.\n\n1. Let the area of one square be \\(A\\).\n2. Since 75% of one square is overlapped by the other, the overlapping area is \\(0.75A\\).\n3. Each overlapping region is divided into two equal parts by a bisector. Therefore, each part of the overlapping region has an area of \\(0.375A\\) (since \\(0.75A / 2 = 0.375A\\)).\n4. The shaded region in this case would be the total overlapping area minus the unshaded part of the overlapping region. Since the bisector divides the overlapping region into two equal parts, the shaded region would be the full overlapping area, i.e., \\(0.75A\\).\n\nTo find the shaded region's percentage of the total area, we divide the shaded area by the total area and multiply by 100:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage of shaded area} = \\left(\\frac{0.75A}{A}\\right) \\times 100 = 7", 0.47999998927116394], ["55", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

This means that the arrangement of balls in the boxes does not matter; only the count of balls in each box does. \n\nGiven that we have 5 distinguishable balls and 2 boxes, we can think of this in terms of partitioning the 5 balls into two groups, where the order of the groups does not matter (e.g., the first box could contain 3 balls and the second box could contain 2 balls, or vice versa, and the result is the same).\n\nWe can use the \"stars and bars\" theorem to determine the number of ways to partition 5 distinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes. However, since the boxes are indistinguishable, we need to ensure that we don't double-count the partitions.\n\nThe number of ways to partition n distinguishable objects into k indistinguishable boxes is given by the Stirling number of the second kind, \\(S(n, k)\\), and then accounting for the indistinguishability of the boxes.\n\nFor this problem, the number of ways to partition 5 balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes is:\n\n\\[ S(5, 2) + S(4, 2) \\]\n\nHere, \\(S(n, k)\\) is the Stirling number of the second kind, which represents the number of ways to partition a set of \\(n\\) objects into \\(k\\) non-empty subsets. We need to calculate \\(S(5, 2)\\) and \\(S(4, 2)\\).\n\nThe Stirling numbers of the second kind for small values are:\n- \\(S(5, 2) = 15\\)\n- \\(S(4, 2) = 7\\)\n\nSo, the total number of ways to partition 5 distinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes is \\(15 + 7 = 22\\).\n\nLet's verify this using Python code.\n```python\nfrom sympy.functions.combinatorial.numbers import stirling\n\n# Calculate the Stirling numbers of the second kind\nS_5_2 = stirling(5, 2)\nS_4_2 = stirling(4, 2)\n\n# Total number of ways to partition 5 balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes\ntotal_ways = S_5_2 + S_4_2\nprint(total_ways)\n```\n```output\n22\n```\nThe total number of ways to put 5 distinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes is \\(\\boxed{22}\\).", 0.20999999344348907], ["55", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.
