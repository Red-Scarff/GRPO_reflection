To find the length of the chord, consider the right triangle formed by the radius of \\(C_3\\) perpendicular to the chord, the radius of \\(C_1\\) or \\(C_2\\) perpendicular to the chord, and half of the chord.\n   - The distance from the center of \\(C_3\\) to the chord can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.

The number \\( a \\) is a Liouville number, which is a transcendental number. However, we only need to consider the first 100 decimal places to find the distinct digits.\n\nThe number \\( a \\) is constructed as follows:\n\\[ a = 1 + 0.01 + 0.0001 + 0.00000001 + \\cdots + 10^{-k^2} + \\cdots \\]\n\nTo find the first 100 decimal places of \\( a \\), we need to sum the first few terms of the series until the 100th decimal place. We can do this by evaluating the series up to a point where the terms are small enough to not affect the first 100 decimal places of the sum.\n\nLet's write a Python code to compute the first 100 decimal places of \\( a \\) and then determine the distinct digits present in those decimal places.\n```python\n# Function to compute the first 100 decimal places of the number a\ndef compute_first_100_decimal_places():\n    a = 0\n    term = 1\n    decimal_places = 100\n    digits = set()\n    \n    for k in range(decimal_places):\n        a += term\n        if k < decimal_places - 1:\n            decimal_places_in_a = len(str(a).split('.')[1])\n            decimal_part = str(a).split('.')[1][:decimal_places_in_a]\n            digits.update(decimal_part)\n        term = 10**(-k**2)\n    \n    return len(digits), digits\n\n# Compute the first 100 decimal places of a and find the distinct digits\nnum_distinct_digits, distinct_digits = compute_first_100_decimal_places()\nprint((num_distinct_digits, distinct_digits))\n```\n```output\n(1, {'0'})\n```\nThe result indicates that there is only one distinct digit (0) present in the first 100 decimal places of the number \\( a \\). This is because the terms of the series \\( 10^{-k^2} \\) are very small and do not contribute to the first 100 decimal places beyond the leading 1 and the first few zeros after the decimal point.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct digits in the first 100 decimal places of \\( a \\) is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).\n\nIn the rectangular coordinate system $(xOy)$, the parametric equation of line $l$ is given by $ \\begin{cases} x=t", 0.38999998569488525], ["40", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

The valid digits (for an even number) are from 0 to 9, but the last digit must be even, so we have 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.\n\nFor each even last digit, we need to choose 2 more digits from the digits that are less than the last digit. For example, if the last digit is 2, we can choose the first two digits from the digits {0, 1}.

Thus, there is 1 valid number (i.e., 122).\n    - For the last digit 4, the valid first two digits can be any combination of {0, 1}, which is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). Thus, there are 6 valid numbers.\n    - For the last digit 6, the valid first two digits can be any combination of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, which is \\(\\binom{6}{2} = 15\\).

Thus, there are 28 valid numbers.\n\n2. **Summing Valid Numbers**:\n    - Total valid numbers = 1 (for last digit 2) + 6 (for last digit 4) + 15 (for last digit 6) + 28 (for last digit 8) = 50.\n    - However, we overlooked the fact that for the last digit 0, the only valid number is 123, which we did not count correctly in the combinations above.

First, determine the number of lambs Merry's brother takes care of. Since Merry takes care of 10 lambs and her brother takes care of 3 more lambs than Merry, her brother takes care of \\(10 + 3 = 13\\) lambs.\n2. Next, consider the lambs that need special attention. These are counted twice, so we need to subtract the extra count of these lambs. There are 2 lambs that need special attention from Merry and 1 lamb that needs special attention from her brother. So, a total of \\(2 + 1 = 3\\) lambs are counted twice.\n3. Therefore, the total number of unique lambs is \\(10 + 13 - 3 = 20\\).\n\nNow let's use Python code to verify this solution.\n```python\n# Number of lambs Merry takes care of\nmerry_lambs = 10\n\n# Number of lambs Merry's brother takes care of\nbrother_lambs = merry_lambs + 3\n\n# Lambs that need special attention\nspecial_attention_lambs = 2 + 1\n\n# Total unique lambs\nunique_lambs = merry_lambs + brother_lambs - special_attention_lambs\nprint(unique_lambs)\n```\n```output\n20\n```\nThe total number of unique lambs that Merry and her brother have is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).\n\nThe opposite of $-3$ is\n\nA: $-\\frac{1}{3}$\n\nB: $\\frac{1}{3}$", 0.4300000071525574], ["40", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

If we assume \\(D_1\\) is on the extension of \\(AB\\) and \\(D_2\\) is on the extension of \\(AC\\), then we can calculate the coordinates of \\(D_1\\) and \\(D_2\\).\n\nSince \\(BD_1 = \\sqrt{11}\\), \\(D_1\\) is at \\(\\left(\\sqrt{111} + \\sqrt{11}, 0\\right)\\).

Now we substitute this into the second congruence:\n\\[\n4k + 3 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}\n\\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[\n4k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}\n\\]\nTo find the value of $k$, we need to find the modular inverse of 4 modulo 5. The modular inverse of 4 modulo 5 is 4 (since $4 \\cdot 4 = 16 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$). So we get:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 4 \\cdot 1 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}\n\\]\nSo, $k = 5a + 4$ for some integer $a$.
