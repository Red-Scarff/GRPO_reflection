Then:\n   \\[\n   n^3 = 2^{3a} \\times 5^{3b} \\times 11^{3c} \\times m^3\n   \\]\n   So the prime factorization of \\(110n^3\\) becomes:\n   \\[\n   110n^3 = 2^{1+3a} \\times 5^{1+3b} \\times 11^{1+3c} \\times m^3\n   \\]\n\n3. **Number of Divisors**:\n   The number of divisors of a number \\(N\\) with prime factorization \\(p_1^{e_1} \\times p_2^{e_2} \\times \\cdots \\times p_k^{e_k}\\) is given by \\((e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1)\\).\n   Given that \\(110n^3\\) has 110 divisors, and 110 factors as \\(110 = 2 \\times 5 \\times 11\\), the exponents in the prime factorization of \\(110n^3\\) must multiply to 110. Since the exponents in \\(2^{1+3a} \\times 5^{1+3b} \\times 11^{1+3c} \\times m^3\\) are \\(1+3a\\), \\(1+3b\\), \\(1+3c\\), and the exponents of all other primes in \\(m\\), we can infer that:\n   \\[\n   (1+3a+1)(1+3b+1)(1+3c+1) \\times (\\text{other factors}) = 110\n   \\]\n   Since 110 is not divisible by 4, one of the factors must be 2. Let's assume \\(1+3a = 2\\), then \\(a = \\frac{1}{3}\\), which is not an integer. So, the only viable option is \\(a = 0\\), which means the exponents must be 2, so \\(1+3a = 2\\) and \\(a = 0\\). Thus, we can assume the exponents are 2, and the other factors must multiply to 27. We can have \\(1+3b = 3\\) and \\(1+3c = 3\\), so \\(b = c = 1\\). The remaining factor must be 3, which can be handled by the exponent of another prime factor in \\(m\\). So, \\(m\\) must have an exponent of 1, and the other prime factor must have an exponent of 2.\n\n4. **Prime Factorization of \\(n\\)**:\n   Given the above, we have:\n   \\[\n   n = 2^0 \\times 5^1 \\times 11^1 \\times p = 5 \\times 11 \\times p\n   \\]\n   where \\(p\\) is a prime number (not 2, 5, or 11).

There are \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\) points in total.\n\n2. **Count All Possible Triples of Points**: We need to choose 3 points out of the 25. The number of ways to choose 3 points from 25 is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{25}{3} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{25}{3} = \\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 2300\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Exclude Collinear Points**: We need to exclude the sets of 3 collinear points because they do not form a triangle with positive area. We will have to count and subtract all such collinear triplets.\n\n4. **Count All Sets of 3 Collinear Points**:\n   - **Horizontal Lines**: There are 5 lines parallel to the x-axis, each containing 5 points. The number of ways to choose 3 collinear points on a single line is \\( \\binom{5}{3} = 10 \\). Since there are 5 such lines, there are \\(5 \\times 10 = 50\\) collinear sets.\n   - **Vertical Lines**: Similarly, there are 5 lines parallel to the y-axis, each containing 5 points. So, there are \\(5 \\times 10 = 50\\) collinear sets.\n   - **Diagonal Lines**: We need to count the collinear sets on the two main diagonals (from \\((1,1)\\) to \\((5,5)\\) and from \\((1,5)\\) to \\((5,1)\\)) and the lines parallel to these diagonals.\n     - The main diagonal lines have 1 line with 5 points, 2 lines with 4 points each, 2 lines with 3 points each, 2 lines with 4 points each, and 1 line with 5 points. This gives \\(1 \\cdot \\binom{5}{3} + 2 \\cdot \\binom{4}{3} + 2 \\cdot \\binom{3}{3} + 2 \\cdot \\binom{4}{3} + 1 \\cdot \\binom{5}{3} = 10 + 8 \\cdot 4 + 2 + 8 + 10 = 54\\).\n     - The lines parallel to the main diagonals are similarly counted, giving another 54 sets.\n   - **Other Diagonal Lines**: There are also 6 lines parallel to the main diagonals (from \\((1,1)\\) to \\((6,4)\\), \\((1,2)\\) to \\((6,3)\\), etc.) and 6 lines parallel to the other direction. We will only count the lines with fewer points, which gives 0 since they will not have enough points to form sets of 3 collinear points.\n\n5. **Calculate the Final Answer**: The total number of collinear sets is \\(50 + 50 + 54 + 54 = 208\\).
