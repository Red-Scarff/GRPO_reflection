Let's proceed with writing the code to achieve this.\n```python\nfrom sympy import primerange\r\n\r\n# Set a reasonable limit to ensure we find enough primes\r\nPRIME_LIMIT = 100\r\n\r\n# Generate a list of prime numbers up to the limit\r\nprime_list = list(primerange(1, PRIME_LIMIT))\r\n\r\n# Initialize a variable to store the smallest sum divisible by 3\r\nsmallest_sum = None\r\n\r\n# Iterate through the list of primes, considering sets of four consecutive primes\r\nfor i in range(len(prime_list) - 3):\r\n    four_consecutive_primes = prime_list[i:i+4]\r\n    current_sum = sum(four_consecutive_primes)\r\n    if current_sum % 3 == 0:\r\n        if smallest_sum is None or current_sum < smallest_sum:\r\n            smallest_sum = current_sum\r\n\r\nprint(smallest_sum)\n```\n```output\n36\n```\nThe smallest possible value of the sum of four consecutive primes that is divisible by three is \\(\\boxed{36}\\).\n\nLet's verify a few things about this result. The four consecutive primes that sum up to 36 are 5, 7, 11, and 13. \n\nLet's confirm:\n\n\\[\n5 + 7 + 11 + 13 = 36\n\\]\n\nSince \\(36 \\div 3 = 12\\), the sum is indeed divisible by 3. Therefore, the smallest possible sum of four consecutive primes that is divisible by three is \\(\\boxed{36}\\).\n\nThe area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semi-circle whose radius is \\(r\\) is: To find the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semi-circle with radius \\(r\\), we need to understand the geometry of the problem. The largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semi-circle is a right triangle with the diameter of the semi-circle as its hypotenuse.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Understand the Geometry**: The diameter of the semi-circle is the hypotenuse of the right triangle. Since the radius of the semi-circle is \\(r\\), the diameter is \\(2r\\).\n2. **Right Triangle Properties**: The right triangle inscribed in the semi-circle with the hypotenuse as the diameter will have its legs equal to the radius \\(r\\). This means the triangle is a right isosceles triangle with two sides equal to \\(r\\).\n3. **Area Calculation**: The area \\(A\\) of a right triangle is given by \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\\). For this triangle, the base and height are both \\(r\\). Thus, the area is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times r \\times r = \\frac{1}{2} r^2\\).\n\nLet's implement this in Python using sympy to confirm the solution.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the radius r\nr = sp.symbols('r')\n\n# Calculate the area of the right triangle inscribed in the semi-circle\narea = (1/2) * r * r\n\n# Simplify the area expression\narea_simplified = sp.simplify(area)\n\nprint(area_simplified)\n```\n```output\n0.5*r**2\n```\nThe output confirms our calculation. The area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semi-circle with radius \\(r\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2} r^2\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2} r^2}\\).\n\nGiven that $\\cos \\alpha = \\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{5}$, with $\\alpha \\in (\\pi, \\frac{3\\pi}{2})$,\n(\u2160) Find the value of $\\sin \\alpha$;\n(\u2161) Find the value of $\\frac{\\sin(\\pi+\\alpha) + 2\\sin(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}+\\alpha)}{\\cos(3\\pi - \\alpha) + 1}$;\n(\u2162) If $\\cos \\beta = -\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5}$, with $\\beta \\in (\\frac{3\\pi}{2}, 2\\pi)$, find the value of $\\tan(\\alpha - \\beta)", 0.49000000953674316], ["30", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Using the change of base formula \\(\\log_8 x = \\frac{\\log_2 x}{\\log_2 8} = \\frac{\\log_2 x}{3}\\), we get:\n\\[\n12 \\cdot \\frac{\\log_2 a}{3} + 66 \\cdot \\frac{\\log_2 r}{3} = 2006.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n4 \\log_2 a + 22 \\log_2 r = 2006.\n\\]\nDividing by 2 gives us:\n\\[\n2 \\log_2 a + 11 \\log_2 r = 1003.\n\\]\nWe can set \\( \\log_2 a = x \\) and \\( \\log_2 r = y \\). Then the equation becomes:\n\\[\n2x + 11y = 1003.\n\\]\nWe need to find the number of ordered pairs \\((x, y)\\) of non-negative integers that satisfy this equation. First, we solve for \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{1003 - 11y}{2}.\n\\]\nFor \\(x\\) to be an integer, \\(1003 - 11y\\) must be even. Since 1003 is odd, \\(11y\\) must be odd, which means \\(y\\) must be odd. We need \\(y\\) to be an integer between 0 and 91 (since \\(11 \\cdot 92 = 1012 > 1003\\)). The possible values for \\(y\\) are \\(1, 3, 5, \\ldots, 91\\). This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term \\(1\\), the last term \\(91\\), and the common difference \\(2\\). The number of terms in this sequence is:\n\\[\n\\frac{91 - 1}{2} + 1 = 46.\n\\]\nThus, there are 46 possible values for \\(y\\), and each value of \\(y\\) corresponds to a unique value of \\(x\\). Therefore, there are 46 possible ordered pairs \\((a, r)\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{46}\n\\]", 1.0], ["30", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Suppose the dot plot shows that heads appeared 10 times and tails appeared 10 times in the 20 trials. This would suggest that the coin is fair, as the observed outcomes are equal to the expected values.\n\nHere is the Python code to create such a dot plot using the `matplotlib` library:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Hypothetical data from the dot plot\nheads = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]  # 10 heads\ntails = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]  # 10 tails\n\n# Combine the data\ndata = heads + tails\n\n# Create the dot plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\nplt.hist(data, bins=[0, 0.5, 1], align='mid', rwidth=0.8, color='blue', alpha=0.5)\nplt.title('Dot Plot of Coin Flip Results')\nplt.xlabel('Outcome')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\nplt.yticks([0, 1], ['0', '1'])\nplt.legend(['Heads', 'Tails'])\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n```\n```output\ntimeout_decorator.timeout_decorator.TimeoutError: 'Timed Out'\n```\nIt seems that the code execution timed out. Let's simplify the code and run it again to create the hypothetical dot plot. We'll use a more straightforward approach to demonstrate the concept without running into timeouts.\n\nHere's the simplified code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Hypothetical data from the dot plot\nheads = 10  # 10 heads", 1.350000023841858], ["30", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

We need to find the height \\( h \\) of a pile of 3 pipes from Crate B. To do this, we need to calculate the distance between the centers of the pipes and then add the radius of the pipes to it.\n\nWhen we look at the arrangement of the pipes in Crate B, we can see that the centers of the top and bottom pipes are aligned vertically with a gap in the middle. The height \\( h \\) will be composed of the radius of the base pipe, the vertical distance between the centers of the two middle pipes, and the radius of the top pipe.\n\nThe vertical distance between the centers of two middle pipes can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. Each pipe has a diameter of 20 cm, so the distance from the center of one pipe to the center of the next one horizontally is 20 cm, and the vertical distance between the centers of two pipes that are directly above each other is what we need to calculate.\n\nConsider a right triangle formed by the vertical distance between the centers of two pipes, half the horizontal distance between the centers of two pipes, and the vertical distance between the centers of two pipes. The half horizontal distance between the centers of two pipes is the horizontal distance divided by 2, which is \\( \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\) cm. The vertical distance between the centers of two pipes is the hypotenuse of this right triangle.\n\nThe height of this triangle is the vertical distance we need to calculate. Let's call this vertical distance \\( d \\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{20}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{20}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{10^2 + 10^2} = \\sqrt{200} = 10\\sqrt{2} \\text{ cm} \\]\n\nThe total height \\( h \\) of the pile of three pipes is then the radius of the base pipe plus the vertical distance \\( d \\) plus the radius of the top pipe. Since the radius of each pipe is 10 cm, the total height \\( h \\) is:\n\\[ h = 10 + 10\\sqrt{2} + 10 = 20 + 10\\sqrt{2} \\text{ cm} \\]\n\nLet's use Python to confirm this calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Diameter of each pipe\ndiameter = 20\nradius = diameter / 2\n\n# Half horizontal distance between the centers of two pipes\nhalf_horizontal_distance = diameter / 2\n\n# Vertical distance between the centers of two pipes\nvertical_distance = math.sqrt(half_horizontal_distance**2 + half_horizontal_distance**2)\n\n# Total height of the pile of three pipes\ntotal_height = radius + vertical_distance + radius\nprint(total_height)\n```\n```output\n34.14213562373095\n```\nThe calculated height \\( h \\) is approximately \\( 34.14213562373095 \\) cm.

The triangle is equilateral with side length 10, because each side consists of two radii. We need to find the height $h=p+q$ of the triangle. We construct a second triangle $SharedPtr$ that is right-angled at $s$ and with base $r$. By trigonometry or Pythagoras' theorem, $\\cos(60^\\circ)=\\frac rp\\implies p=\\frac r2=5,$ and $\\cos(30^\\circ)=\\frac {qs}{pq}\\implies\\frac {\\sqrt 3}2h=5\\cdot2\\sqrt 3\\implies h=\\boxed{5\\sqrt 3}$ \\solution none \n[Solution is based on a 30 degree right angle triangle]\n\nigorpoint\nWe can get the unknown height using the properties of geometric figures and 3D geometry. Here, the three pipes in Crate B form an equilateral triangle with a side length of 10 (since the distance between the centers of the pipes is equal to the sum of their radii).\n\nThe height of a regular tetrahedron (formed by the centers of the three pipes) can be found using the formula for the height of a regular tetrahedron with side length $a$: $h = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}a$. However, in this case, the tetrahedron is not regular because the height from the base to the apex involves the radius of the top pipe as well. Therefore, we need to consider the height from the bottom base to the apex of the pipe formation, which is slightly more complex. \n\nWe can use the following approach:\n1. The vertical distance from the center of each pipe to the ground (assuming the ground is the lowest base) is the radius of the pipe plus the height of the equilateral triangle formed by the centers of the pipes minus the height from the base of the equilateral triangle to the apex of the right-angled triangle formed by the top pipe.\n2. The height of the equilateral triangle with side length 10 is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\times 10 = 5\\sqrt{3}$.\n3. The height from the base of the equilateral triangle to the apex of the right-angled triangle formed by the top pipe is $2\\sqrt{3}$ (because the right-angled triangle formed at the intersection has legs satisfying $\\cos(60^\\circ) = \\frac{5}{p} = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\cos(30^\\circ) = \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{p}$, giving $p = 10$ and the height $2\\sqrt{3}$).\n\nSo, the total height $h$ is the height of the equilateral triangle plus the height of the right-angled triangle, which is $5\\sqrt{3} + 10\\sqrt{3} = 5\\sqrt{3} \\times \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{15\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the side length of the equilateral triangle\na = 10\n\n# Calculate the height of the equilateral triangle\nheight_equilateral = (sp.sqrt(3) / 2) * a\n\n# Calculate the height from the base of the equilateral triangle to the apex of the right-angled triangle\nheight_rightangled = 2 * sp.sqrt(3)\n\n# The total height\ntotal_height = height_equilateral + height_rightangled\n\nprint(total_height)\n```\n```output\n15*sqrt(3)/2\n```\nThe height of the pile of three pipes in Crate B is $\\frac{15\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.

A swap refers to choosing two consecutive blocks and then swapping their positions. Let  $A$  be the minimum number of swaps needed to make the first  $n$  blocks all red and  $B$  be the minimum number of swaps needed to make the last  $n$  blocks all blue. Find the maximum value of  $\\min \\{ A,B \\}$  taken over all possible original arrangements of the blocks. Let's break down the problem and write Python code to find the solution. The problem is asking for the maximum value of the minimum of two quantities: \\(A\\) (the minimum number of swaps needed to put the first \\(n\\) blocks all red) and \\(B\\) (the minimum number of swaps needed to put the last \\(n\\) blocks all blue). \n\nWe can reason that the optimal strategy is to move the minimum number of blocks needed to achieve the desired configuration. To achieve this, let's consider an optimal strategy where we move from the initial configuration to either a configuration with the first \\(n\\) blocks all red or the last \\(n\\) blocks all blue.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Calculate \\(A\\)**: The minimum number of swaps needed to make the first \\(n\\) blocks all red. This is equivalent to moving the \\(n\\) blue blocks to the leftmost \\(n\\) positions, which is the same as solving the problem of moving \\(n\\) blocks in a line to their correct positions.\n\n2. **Calculate \\(B\\)**: The minimum number of swaps needed to make the last \\(n\\) blocks all blue. This is equivalent to moving the \\(n\\) red blocks to the rightmost \\(n\\) positions, which is the same as solving the problem of moving \\(n\\) blocks in a line to their correct positions.\n\nThe key is to find the worst-case scenario where one of these configurations might be difficult to achieve with the minimum number of swaps. One of the worst scenarios would be when the arrangement alternates (i.e., red, blue, red, blue, ...), and from there, it becomes clear that we need to perform the minimum number of swaps to achieve either the first \\(n\\) blocks all red or the last \\(n\\) blocks all blue.\n\nLet", 0.38999998569488525], ["30", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.
