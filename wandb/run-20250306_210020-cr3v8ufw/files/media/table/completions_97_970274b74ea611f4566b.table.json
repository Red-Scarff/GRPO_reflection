Subtract this probability from 1 to get the probability that they don't all show the same number.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the probability that all four dice show the same number. There are 6 possible numbers for the first die, and for each of these, there is only 1 way for the remaining three dice to match that number. Since there are $6^4$ possible outcomes when rolling four 6-sided dice, the probability that all four dice show the same number is:\n\\[ \\frac{6}{6^4} = \\frac{6}{1296} = \\frac{1}{216}. \\]\n\nNow, the probability that they don't all show the same number is:\n\\[ 1 - \\frac{1}{216} = \\frac{215}{216}. \\]\n\nLet's confirm this with Python code to ensure accuracy.\n```python\n# Define the total number of outcomes when rolling four 6-sided dice\r\ntotal_outcomes = 6**4\r\n\r\n# Define the number of favorable outcomes where all four dice show the same number\r\nfavorable_outcomes = 6\r\n\r\n# Calculate the probability that all four dice show the same number\r\nprob_all_same = favorable_outcomes / total_outcomes\r\n\r\n# Calculate the probability that they don't all show the same number\r\nprob_not_all_same = 1 - prob_all_same\r\n\r\nprint(prob_not_all_same)\n```\n```output\n0.9953703703703703\n```\nThe probability that when we roll four fair 6-sided dice, they won't all show the same number is \\(\\frac{215}{216}\\), which is approximately \\(0.9953703703703703\\).\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{215}{216}}\n\\]\n\nFind the number of ordered quadruples of positive integers  $(a,b,c, d)$  such that  $ab + cd = 10$ .\nTo find the number of ordered quadruples $(a, b, c, d)$ such that $ab + cd = 10$, we can systematically check all possible values for $a, b, c,$ and $d$. Since $a, b, c,$ and $d$ are positive integers, we only need to consider values that can make $ab$ and $cd$ positive integers and that keep the sum less than or equal to 10.

Let's denote the point where $CD$ intersects $AE$ as $D$, and the point where $AB$ intersects $CE$ as $B$.\n3. Since $AB = 4$ and $CD = 8$, we can use the similarity of triangles $ACD$ and $ABC$ to find the length of $CE$.\n\nFirst, let's denote the length of $AD$ as $x$. Then the length of $DE$ is $5 - x$. Since $CD \\perp AE$ and $AB \\perp CE$, the triangles $ACD$ and $ABC$ are right triangles, and we can use the similarity of these triangles.\n\nThe similarity of triangles $ACD$ and $ABC$ implies that:\n\\[\n\\frac{AB}{CD} = \\frac{BC}{DE} = \\frac{AC}{AE}\n\\]\n\nSince $AB \\perp CE$, $AB$ is the altitude of triangle $ACE$. The length of $CE$ can be found using the geometric mean theorem (also known as the altitude-on-hypotenuse theorem for right triangles).\n\nFrom the given information:\n\\[\nAB^2 = AD \\cdot AE\n\\]\n\\[\n4^2 = x \\cdot 5\n\\]\n\\[\n16 = 5x\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{16}{5}\n\\]\n\nSo, $AD = \\frac{16}{5}$ and $DE = 5 - \\frac{16}{5} = \\frac{9}{5}$.\n\nNow, we can use the similarity of triangles to find $CE$. Since $\\triangle ACD \\sim \\triangle ABC$:\n\\[\n\\frac{AB}{CD} = \\frac{BC}{DE}\n\\]\nSince $BC = CE - BE$ and $BE$ is the altitude of triangle $BCE$, we can use the similarity again to find $CE$.\n\nLet's denote the length of $CE$ as $y$. Then we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{BC}{\\frac{9}{5}}\n\\]\nSince $BC = y - BE$ and $BE = AB = 4$, we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{y - 4}{\\frac{9}{5}}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{10} = y - 4\n\\]\n\\[\ny = \\frac{9}{10} + 4\n\\]\n\\[\ny = \\frac{9}{10} + \\frac{40}{10} = \\frac{49}{10}\n\\]\n\nSo, the length of $CE$ is $\\frac{49}{10}$.\n\nLet's confirm this with the code:\n```python\n# Given values\r\nAB = 4\r\nCD = 8\r\nAE = 5\r\n\r\n# Calculate AD using the similarity of triangles\r\nAD = (AB ** 2) / CD\r\n\r\n# Calculate DE\r\nDE = AE - AD\r\n\r\n# Using the similarity of triangles ACD and ABC\r\n# AB/CD = BC/DE\r\n# BC = CE - BE and BE = AB = 4\r\n# So, AB/CD = (CE - 4) / DE\r\n# 4/8 = (CE - 4) / (9/5)\r\n# 1/2 = (CE - 4) / (9/5)\r\n# CE - 4 = (9/10)\r\n# CE = (9/10) + 4\r\nCE = (9/10) + 4\r\n\r\nprint(CE)\n```\n```output\n4.9\n```\nThe length of $CE$ is $\\frac{49}{10}$, which is equivalent to 4.9.

If \\( x = p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot p_k^{e_k} \\), then the number of divisors of \\( x \\) is given by:\n   - \\( (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1) = 12 \\)\n4. We need to find the combination of exponents \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) that satisfy this condition and include the factors 2, 3, and 5. The possible factorizations of 12 are:\n   - \\( 12 = 12 \\cdot 1 \\)\n   - \\( 12 = 6 \\cdot 2 \\)\n   - \\( 12 = 4 \\cdot 3 \\)\n   - \\( 12 = 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\)\n   - \\( 12 = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\)\n5. We need to choose the combination that includes the primes 2, 3, and 5. The simplest combination that works is \\( 12 = 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\), which means \\( (a+1)(b+1)(c+1) = 12 \\). This suggests that \\( a+1 = 3 \\), \\( b+1 = 2 \\), and \\( c+1 = 2 \\), giving us \\( a = 2 \\), \\( b = 1 \\), and \\( c = 1 \\).\n6. Thus, the prime factorization of \\( x \\) is:\n   - \\( x = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 60 \\)\n\nLet's verify this with Python code to ensure accuracy.\n```python\n# Function to calculate the number of divisors of a number\ndef count_divisors(n):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            if i * i == n:\n                count += 1\n            else:\n                count += 2\n    return count\n\n# Check if 60 has 12 divisors and is divisible by both 12 and 15\nx = 60\ndivisors_count = count_divisors(x)\nis_divisible_by_12 = (x % 12 == 0)\nis_divisible_by_15 = (x % 15 == 0)\n\nprint(((divisors_count, is_divisible_by_12, is_divisible_by_15)))\n```\n```output\n(12, True, True)\n```\nThe number 60 has 12 divisors, and it is divisible by both 12 and 15. Therefore, the integer \\( x \\) that meets the given criteria is \\(\\boxed{60}\\).", 1.2999999523162842]]}
