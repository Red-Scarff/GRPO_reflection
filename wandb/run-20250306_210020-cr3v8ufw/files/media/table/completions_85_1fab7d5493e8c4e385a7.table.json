However, we can reason through the problem and verify the solution \\(x = 2\\) manually.\n\nSince the equation involves exponential terms and the values of \\(2 + \\sqrt{3}\\) and \\(2 - \\sqrt{3}\\) are close to each other (one is slightly larger than the other but still close), the terms \\((2 + \\sqrt{3})^x\\) and \\((2 - \\sqrt{3})^x\\) will be close to each other for \\(x = 2\\). For \\(x = 2\\), we have:\n\\[\n(2 + \\sqrt{3})^2 + (2 - \\sqrt{3})^2 = (4 + 4\\sqrt{3} + 3) + (4 - 4\\sqrt{3} + 3) = 8 + 6 = 14.\n\\]\nThis confirms that \\(x = 2\\) is indeed a solution.\n\nTo ensure there are no other solutions, let's consider the behavior of the terms \\((2 + \\sqrt{3})^x\\) and \\((2 - \\sqrt{3})^x\\) for other values of \\(x\\). The term \\((2 - \\sqrt{3})^x\\) will always be less than 1 for \\(x > 0\\) because \\(2 - \\sqrt{3} < 1\\), and it will approach 0 as \\(x\\) increases. Therefore, the sum \\((2 + \\sqrt{3})^x + (2 - \\sqrt{3})^x\\) will be dominated by \\((2 + \\sqrt{3})^x\\) for large \\(x\\), and it will not equal 14 for any other positive \\(x\\).

However, we can check if there was any misinterpretation. The correct interpretation is that the constant term should match. Since \\(b = 0\\) does not satisfy \\(b^2 = 84\\), we need to recheck the constant term. The correct form should be \\(10x - 4y + 24z = 55\\), so the constant term should match.
