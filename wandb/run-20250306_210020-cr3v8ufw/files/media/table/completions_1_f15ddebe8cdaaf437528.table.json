Let's denote the expression under the square root as \\(N\\):\n\n\\[ N = (31)(30)(29)(28) + 1 \\]\n\nTo simplify the calculation, we can hypothesize that \\(N\\) is a perfect square by expressing it in a form that resembles a square of a product or a sum. Notice that 31 and 29 are symmetric around 30, as are 30 and 28. So, we can use the difference of squares formula in a more abstract way.\n\nConsider the expression:\n\n\\[ N = (31)(30)(29)(28) + 1 \\]\n\nWe can rewrite this in a more convenient form:\n\n\\[ N = (30^2 - 1)(30^2 - 1) + 1 \\]\n\\[ N = (30^2 - 1)^2 + 1 \\]\n\nNow, let's expand this:\n\n\\[ N = (900 - 1)^2 + 1 = 899^2 + 1 \\]\n\nTo confirm that this is a perfect square, we need to check if \\(899^2 + 1\\) is a perfect square. We can do this by checking if there exists an integer \\(k\\) such that:\n\n\\[ k^2 = 899^2 + 1 \\]\n\\[ k^2 - 899^2 = 1 \\]\n\nThis is a difference of squares, and we can solve it by:\n\n\\[ (k - 899)(k + 899) = 1 \\]\n\nThe only integer solutions to this are \\(k - 899 = 1\\) and \\(k + 899 = 1\\), or \\(k - 899 = -1\\) and \\(k + 899 = -1\\). In either case, \\(k = 900\\), so \\(899^2 + 1 = 900^2\\), which is a perfect square.\n\nThus, we have:\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{899^2 + 1} = 900 \\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{900} \\]\n\nLet's verify this using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the expression (31 * 30 * 29 * 28 + 1)\nN = 31 * 30 * 29 * 28 + 1\n\n# Calculate the square root of N\nsqrt_N = math.isqrt(N)\n\nprint((N, sqrt_N))\n```", 0.3499999940395355], ["0", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

The overall proof is complete when $Q(n)$ is shown for all natural numbers $n$.\nDoes n define the last number in a brute force search (i.e. the highest value test checked) ? As there is no ceiling to the number search once you have reached the conclusion. Best practice is to state the target value as a hard constraint. Otherwise, it means you are ignoring the case where the target cannot be reached by the base case (for your primitive recursion), and have to prove this beforehand, for example by induction.\nFor example:\n$$F(x,y)=x-2y$$\nBefor we start, $$x\\le 2y \\wedge \\forall z (z\\le x \\rightarrow z < x) \\wedge \\forall y (y\\le x)$$\nState the base case and predicate to be true. \n$$Base \\space Case: F(0,0) = 0$$\n$$P(x,y): x-2y\\ge 0$$\nThen show:\n$$P(x,y) \\rightarrow P(x-1,y) \\rightarrow P(x-2,y) \\rightarrow P(x,0)$$\nOnce you've proven your predicate is true over all integers, you can apply it to your function and make sure there is some range of parameters where your equation gives $0$.\nNote that in my example, I've solved the problem by induction to show that true predicates are passable, so I could have also done brute force, which would be a lot more work because I wouldn't know when to stop searching, which would complicate the proof. That's one of the biggest differences between proof by induction and brute force (assuming you're testing against a polynomial-time algorithm).\nI hope this helps!\nSkipper\nI have been using the same method for several years and never had a problem with it. However, I've noticed that some people aren't very familiar with mathematical induction, so there's always the path to take to get around it. \nIn some proofs we're able to look at the case at which the predicate isn't true, so this is one example. \nIn general, I would make sure I've properly proven all cases before answering something like this, and also if the argument is quite impractical to the point where we'd", 0.38999998569488525], ["0", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Let's look at how the value of $n^2 + 2n + 10$ changes as $n$ increases. The expression can be rewritten as $(n + 1)^2 + 9$. Since $(n + 1)^2$ is always nonnegative, the smallest value of the expression occurs when $(n + 1)^2 = 0$, which happens when $n = -1$. In that case, the value of the expression is $10$, which is composite. As $n$ increases, $(n + 1)^2$ increases, so the value of the expression also increases.

Let's first find the value of \\(c\\) using the intersection at \\(x = -2\\):\n\\[f(-2) = \\frac{(-2)^2 - 6(-2) + 6}{2(-2) - 4} = \\frac{4 + 12 + 6}{-8 - 4} = \\frac{22}{-12} = -\\frac{11}{6}.\\]\nSince \\(g(-2) = f(-2)\\), we have:\n\\[\\frac{-2(-2)^2 + 2(-2) + c}{-2 - 2} = -\\frac{11}{6} \\Rightarrow \\frac{-8 - 4 + c}{-4} = -\\frac{11}{6} \\Rightarrow \\frac{-12 + c}{-4} = -\\frac{11}{6} \\Rightarrow -12 + c = \\frac{22}{3} \\Rightarrow c = \\frac{22}{3} + 12 = \\frac{22 + 36}{3} = \\frac{58}{3}.\\]\nSo, \\(g(x) = \\frac{-2x^2 + 2x + \\frac{58}{3}}{x - 2}\\).\n\nNow, we need to find the other intersection point by solving \\(f(x) = g(x)\\):\n\\[\\frac{x^2 - 6x + 6}{2x - 4} = \\frac{-2x^2 + 2x + \\frac{58}{3}}{x - 2}.\\]\nSince \\(2x - 4 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 2\\) is a vertical asymptote, we can simplify:\n\\[\\frac{x^2 - 6x", 0.4300000071525574], ["0", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Find the intersection points of \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) and identify the one that does not lie on the line \\(x = -2\\).\n\n### Step 1: Vertical Asymptote of \\(f(x)\\)\nThe vertical asymptote of \\(f(x)\\) is where the denominator is zero, i.e., \\(2x - 4 = 0 \\rightarrow x = 2\\).

The quotient is \\(ax + (ad + b)\\), so the oblique asymptote is \\(y = ax + (ad + b)\\).\n\n4. **Orthogonality of the oblique asymptotes:** The oblique asymptotes are perpendicular, so their slopes must satisfy the equation \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot a = -1\\), giving \\(a = -2\\).\n\n5. **Intersection of oblique asymptotes:** The oblique asymptotes intersect on the \\(y\\)-axis, so setting \\(x = 0\\) in both asymptotes gives the same \\(y\\)-coordinate.

The oriented chromatic index of a directed graph (digraph) is a concept that extends the idea of chromatic number to directed graphs. In graph theory, the chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. For a digraph, the oriented chromatic index, denoted by \\(\\chi'_o(G)\\), is the smallest number of colors needed to color the arcs (directed edges) of the digraph such that no two arcs entering the same vertex have the same color, and no two arcs leaving the same vertex have the same color.\n\nRecent advancements in understanding the bounds of the oriented chromatic index have been significant. One of the key results is the establishment of a relationship between the oriented chromatic index and the well-known chromatic index of the underlying undirected graph. The chromatic index of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color its edges such that no two adjacent edges share the same color.\n\nIt has been shown that for any digraph \\(G\\), the oriented chromatic index \\(\\chi'_o(G)\\) is at most the chromatic index of the underlying undirected graph of \\(G\\) plus one, i.e., \\(\\chi'_o(G) \\leq \\chi(G) + 1\\). This result provides a useful upper bound for the oriented chromatic index based on the chromatic number of the undirected graph.\n\nAdditionally, there have been efforts to find specific bounds for certain classes of digraphs. For example, for tournaments (a type of digraph where there is exactly one directed edge between any two vertices), it has been shown that the oriented chromatic index is at most 3 times the chromatic number of the underlying undirected graph, i.e., \\(\\chi'_o(T) \\leq 3\\chi(T)\\) for any tournament \\(T\\).\n\nThese bounds and results help in understanding the complexity of coloring oriented graphs and have implications in various applications, such as scheduling and network design.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\chi'_o(G) \\leq \\chi(G) + 1}\n\\]\n\nIn the study of formal languages, could you explain what languages are considered complete in neural nets unless CRP is easier than PE?

The teacher asks the students to calculate the frequency of the word \"cat\" in the story. Afterward, the teacher challenges the class to find out how many more times the word \"cat\" must appear in the next part of the story to increase its frequency to 0.2.\nTo determine the frequency of the word \"cat\" in the story, we start by using the formula for frequency:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Frequency} = \\frac{\\text{Number of times the word appears}}{\\text{Total number of words}}\n\\]\n\nGiven that the word \"cat\" appears 3 times and the total number of words in the story is 15, we can calculate the frequency as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Frequency} = \\frac{3}{15} = 0.2\n\\]\n\nNow, the teacher asks us to find out how many more times the word \"cat\" must appear in the next part of the story to increase its frequency to 0.2.

Let's denote the two squares as \\( a^2 \\) and \\( b^2 \\), with \\( a > b \\).\n\n## Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Equation Setup:\n   Since the problem involves two perfect squares and their difference, we can write:\n   \\[\n   a^2 - b^2 = 133\n   \\]\n   We know that \\(a^2 - b^2 \\) can be factored into:\n   \\[\n   a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)\n   \\]\n\n2. Factorize 133:\n   Next, we need to find two factors of 133. The factors of 133 are 1, 7, 19, and 133. However, since \\( a + b \\) and \\( a - b \\) must be of the same parity (even or both odd), the only possible factor pairs to consider are (7, 19) and (-7, -19).\n\n3. Possible Pairs of Factors:\n   Let's analyze the possible pairs:\n   - \\( a + b = 19 \\) and \\( a - b = 7 \\)\n   - \\( a + b = -19 \\) and \\( a - b = -7 \\)\n\n4. Solve for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):\n   Adding the equations:\n   \\[\n   (a + b) + (a - b) = 19 + 7 \\implies 2a = 26 \\implies a = 13\n   \\]\n   Subtracting the equations:\n   \\[\n   (a + b) - (a - b) = 19 - 7 \\implies 2b = 12 \\implies b = 6\n   \\]\n\n5. Calculate the Sum of the Squares:\n   Now we verify by substituting \\(a = 13\\) and \\(b = 6\\):\n   \\[\n   a^2 = 13^2 = 169\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   b^2 = 6^2 = 36\n   \\]\n   The sum of these squares is:\n   \\[\n   169 + 36 = 205\n   \\]\n\n6. Check for Minimum:\n   Rechecking for smaller values, we see that using \\(a = 5\\) and \\(b = 4\\):\n   \\[\n   a^2 = 5^2 = 25\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   b^2 = 4^2 = 16\n   \\]\n   Sum is:\n   \\[\n   25 + 16 = 41\n   \\]\n\n   However, the smallest possible difference between the squares can be achieved when \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are consecutive integers. Thus, \\(a = 8\\) and \\(b = 7\\):\n   \\[\n   a^2 = 8^2 = 64\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   b^2 = 7^2 = 49\n   \\]\n   Sum is:\n   \\[\n   64 + 49 = 113\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible sum of the two perfect squares is \\(113\\).", 0.4300000071525574], ["0", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.
