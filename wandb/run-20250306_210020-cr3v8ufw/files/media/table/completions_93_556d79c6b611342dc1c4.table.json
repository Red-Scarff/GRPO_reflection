Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Reflection Property**:\n    - The law of reflection states that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.

So the reflection of point \\( A = (-3, 9, 11) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   A' = (-3, 9, 11) - 2 \\frac{(-3 + 9 + 11 - 12)}{3} (1, 1, 1) = (-3, 9, 11) - 2 \\cdot 5 (1, 1, 1) = (-3, 9, 11) - (10, 10, 10) = (-13, -1, 1)\n   \\]\n2. The point \\( B \\) is the intersection of the line \\( AC' \\) with the plane \\( x + y + z = 12 \\). The parametric equation of the line \\( AC' \\) is:\n   \\[\n   (x, y, z) = (-3, 9, 11) + t (13 + 1, -1 - 9, 1 - 11) = (-3 + 14t, 9 - 10t, 11 - 10t)\n   \\]\n3. Substituting the parametric equation into the plane equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   (-3 + 14t) + (9 - 10t) + (11 - 10t) = 12 \\implies 17 - 16t = 12 \\implies t = \\frac{5}{16}\n   \\]\n4. Substituting \\( t = \\frac{5}{16} \\) back into the parametric equation, we find the coordinates of \\( B \\):\n   \\[\n   B = \\left(-3 + 14 \\cdot \\frac{5}{16}, 9 - 10 \\cdot \\frac{5}{16}, 11 - 10 \\cdot \\frac{5}{16}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{-48 + 70}{16}, \\frac{144 - 50}{16}, \\frac{176 - 50}{16}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{22}{16}, \\frac{94}{16}, \\frac{126}{16}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{11}{8}, \\frac{47}{8}, \\frac{63}{8}\\right)\n   \\]\n\nThe coordinates of point \\( B \\) are \\(\\left(\\frac{11}{8}, \\frac{47}{8}, \\frac{63}{8}\\right)\\).

We can handle the absolute value manually by considering the two cases separately.\n\nLet's manually solve the equation \\(|2h - 6| = |2h + 2|\\):\n\n1. \\(2h - 6 = 2h + 2\\), which simplifies to \\(-6 = 2\\), a contradiction.\n2. \\(2h - 6 = -(2", 0.33000001311302185], ["50", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

First, we need to find the rate at which one faucet fills the tub. Since three faucets fill a 100-gallon tub in 6 minutes, the combined rate of the three faucets is \\(\\frac{100 \\text{ gallons}}{6 \\text{ minutes}}\\).

However, during harvest season, if a field has more than 10 rows, each row will have an additional 2 corn cobs. How many corn cobs has the farm grown?\nLet's break down the problem into smaller steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of corn cobs in the first field before and after the harvest season.\n2. Calculate the number of corn cobs in the second field before and after the harvest season.\n3. Sum the total number of corn cobs from both fields.\n\nAssume the initial number of corn cobs per row before the harvest season is \\( x \\). Then after the harvest season (if applicable), the number of corn cobs per row will be \\( x + 2 \\).\n\nThe first field has 13 rows before the harvest season. If the number of rows is more than 10, each row will have an additional 2 corn cobs during the harvest season. Thus, in the harvest season, the first field will have \\( 13 + 3 = 16 \\) rows.\n\nThe second field has 16 rows before the harvest season. If the number of rows is more than 10, each row will have an additional 2 corn cobs during the harvest season. Thus, in the harvest season, the second field will have \\( 16 + 3 = 19 \\) rows.\n\nSo, the total number of corn cobs in the first field will be \\( 16 \\times (x + 2) \\), and the total number of corn cobs in the second field will be \\( 19 \\times (x + 2) \\).\n\nThe total number of corn cobs in the farm will be the sum of the corn cobs from the first and second fields.\n\nLet's calculate it in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of rows before harvest season\nrows_first_field = 13\nrows_second_field = 16\n\n# Define the additional corn cobs per row during harvest season\nadditional_corn_cobs = 2\n\n# Calculate the number of rows during harvest season\nrows_first_field_harvest = rows_first_field + (10 - rows_first_field) + additional_corn_cobs\nrows_second_field_harvest = rows_second_field + (10 - rows_second_field) + additional_corn_cobs\n\n# Define the initial number of corn cobs per row (assuming x)\n# For simplicity, let's assume x = 1, as the initial number of corn cobs per row does not affect the relative difference in crop count\ninitial_corn_cobs_per_row = 1\n\n# Calculate the total number of corn cobs in each field during harvest season\ntotal_corn_cobs_first_field = rows_first_field_harvest * (initial_corn_cobs_per_row + additional_corn_cobs)\ntotal_corn_cobs_second_field = rows_second_field_harvest * (initial_corn_cobs_per_row + additional_corn_cobs)\n\n# Calculate the total number of corn cobs in the farm\ntotal_corn_cobs = total_corn_cobs_first_field + total_corn_cobs_second_field\nprint(total_corn_cobs)\n```\n```output\n71\n```\nGiven the output, let's verify and finalize the solution:\n\n1.

The possible pairs $(a, b)$ are:\n\\[(1, 12), (2, 6), (3, 4), (4, 3), (6, 2), (12, 1)\\]\n\nFor each pair, we can calculate $c = a + b$ and then $N = abc$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n&(1, 12, 13) & N &= 1 \\cdot 12 \\cdot 13 = 156 \\\\\n&(2, 6, 8) & N &= 2 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 8 = 96 \\\\\n&(3, 4, 7) & N &= 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 7 = 84 \\\\\n&(4, 3, 7) & N &= 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 = 84 \\\\\n&(6, 2, 8) & N &= 6 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8 = 96 \\\\\n&(12, 1, 13) & N &= 12 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 13 = 156 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThe distinct values of $N$ are $156$, $96$, and $84$. The sum of these values is:\n\\[156 + 96 + 84 = 336\\]\n\nSo the sum of all possible values of $N$ is $\\boxed{336}$.
