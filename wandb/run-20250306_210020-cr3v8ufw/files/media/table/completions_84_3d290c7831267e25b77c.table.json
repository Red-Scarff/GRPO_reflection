In a linear search algorithm, you traverse the array once from the first element to the last. If the key is not found, you continue to the next element. Since the array A[] has n + 1 elements, you will traverse up to the n + 1 element, but you do not print the key at the last element as the search ends there.

Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. The loop condition depends on the logarithm of the array size because binary search has a time complexity of O(log n). The loop will run as long as the search interval is not empty, which is when i is less than or equal to log n + 1.\n\nQuestion 3: Consider the following C code:\n```c\nint a[10];\nint i = 0;\nwhile (i < 10) {\n    a[i] = i;\n    i++;\n}\n```\nWhich of the following statements would most accurately describe the contents of the array a after the loop completes?\na) a[0] to a[9] are all zero\nb) a[1] to a[10] are all zero\nc) a[0] to a[9] are all zero except for a[10] which is also zero but a[11] which is not yet processed is also zero\nd) a[1] to a[9] are all zero except for a[10] which is not zero and actually contains the value 10\nThe correct answer is d) a[1] to a[9] are all zero except for a[10] which is not zero and actually contains the value 10. The loop initializes i to 0 and increments it after each iteration. This means that a[0] is set to 0, a[1] is set to 1, and so on, until a[9] is set to 9.

Since the triangular prism is removed, the surface area added is just the surface area of the triangular prism, which we have already calculated as \\(198\\).\n\nTherefore, the total surface area of the solid \\(S\\) is \\(384 - 198 + 198 = 384\\).\n\nHowever, this calculation does not account for the fact that the tunnel's walls add additional surface area. The correct approach is to realize that the surface area added by the tunnel's walls is actually the surface area of the original cube minus the surface area of the triangular prism plus the surface area of the triangular prism's walls.

We'll use Python and SymPy to find the surface area of the solid \\( S \\) after drilling the tunnel through the cube.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry\nWe have a cube with side length 8. The tunnel is drilled through the cube with sides parallel to \\(\\overline{AE}\\) and containing the edges \\(\\overline{IJ}\\), \\(\\overline{JK}\\), and \\(\\overline{KI}\\). The points \\(I\\), \\(J\\), and \\(K\\) are on \\(\\overline{EF}\\), \\(\\overline{EH}\\), and \\(\\overline{EC}\\) respectively, and \\(EI = EJ = EK = 2\\).\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the Surface Area of the Cube\nThe surface area of the original cube is \\(6 \\times 8^2 = 384\\).\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Surface Area of the Tunnel\nThe tunnel is a triangular prism with a base that is an equilateral triangle with side length \\(2\\sqrt{2}\\) (since \\(EI = EJ = EK = 2\\) and the cube has side length 8, the distance from \\(E\\) to the midpoint of \\(\\overline{IJ}\\), \\(\\overline{JK}\\), or \\(\\overline{KI}\\) is 4). The height of the prism is the side length of the cube, which is 8.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the area of the equilateral triangle base of the tunnel. The area \\(A\\) of an equilateral triangle with side length \\(s\\) is given by:\n\\[ A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2. \\]\nHere, \\(s = 2\\sqrt{2}\\), so:\n\\[ A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} (2\\sqrt{2})^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 8 = 2\\sqrt{3}. \\]\nThe surface area of the tunnel includes the three rectangular sides and the two equilateral triangles. There are three rectangular sides, each with area \\(2\\sqrt{2} \\times 8 = 16\\sqrt{2}\\), so the total surface area of these sides is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 16\\sqrt{2} = 48\\sqrt{2}. \\]\nThe total surface area of the tunnel is the sum of the areas of the three rectangular sides and the two equilateral triangle bases:\n\\[ 48\\sqrt{2} + 2 \\times 2\\sqrt{3} = 48\\sqrt{2} + 4\\sqrt{3}. \\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Surface Area of the Solid \\(S\\)\nThe surface area of the solid \\(S\\) is the surface area of the original cube minus the area of the three rectangles that were removed by the tunnel, plus the surface area of the tunnel (since it adds to the surface area of the solid). The area of the three rectangles is \\(16\\sqrt{2} \\times 3 = 48\\sqrt{2}\\), so the surface area of \\(S\\) is:\n\\[ 384 - 48\\sqrt{2} + 48\\sqrt{2} + 4\\sqrt{3} = 384 + 4\\sqrt{3}. \\]\nThus, \\(m = 384\\), \\(n = 4\\), and \\(p = 3\\). Therefore, \\(m + n + p = 384 + 4 + 3 = 391\\).\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{391}\\).\n\nLet's verify this with Python code.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import sqrt\n\n# Original surface area of the cube\noriginal_surface_area = 6 * 8**2\n\n# Area of one equilateral triangle base\nside_length_triangle = 2 * sqrt(2)\narea_triangle = (sqrt(3) / 4) * side_length_triangle**2\n\n# Surface area of the tunnel (three rectangular sides + two equilateral triangle bases)\narea_rectangular_sides = 3 * 16 * sqrt(2)\narea_tunnel_bases = 2 * area_triangle\ntotal_tunnel_area = area_rectangular_sides + area_tunnel_bases\n\n# Surface area of the resulting solid\nresulting_surface_area = original_surface_area - area_rectangular_sides + total_tunnel_area\n\n# Extracting m, n, p from the resulting surface area expression\nm = resulting_surface_area.as_coefficients_dict()[1]\nn = resulting_surface_area.as_coefficients_dict()[sqrt(3)]\np = 3\n\n# Calculating the final answer\nfinal_answer = m", 0.47999998927116394], ["45", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Identify the cube dimensions:**\n   Since $EC = 8$ and $EFGH$, $EFDC$, and $EHBC$ are square faces of the cube, the side length of the cube is 8. The coordinates of the vertices of the cube can be set as follows:\n   - $E = (0, 0, 0)$\n   - $A = (8, 0, 0)$\n   - $F = (0, 8, 0)$\n   - $H = (0, 0, 8)$\n   - $C = (0, 8, 8)$\n   - $D = (8, 8, 0)$\n   - $B = (8, 0, 8)$\n\n2. **Identify the points $I$, $J$, and $K$:**\n   - $I = (0, 2, 0)$\n   - $J = (2, 0, 0)$\n   - $K = (0, 0, 2)$\n\n3. **Determine the equation of the plane containing $\\overline{IJ}$, $\\overline{JK}$, and $\\overline{KI}$:**\n   The plane containing these points can be determined using the cross product of vectors $\\overrightarrow{IJ}$ and $\\overrightarrow{JK}$.\n\n4. **Calculate the surface area of the solid $S$:**\n   The original surface area of the cube is $6 \\times 8^2 = 384$. After drilling the tunnel, the surface area is reduced by the area of the cross-section of the tunnel but increased by the lateral surface area of the tunnel. The cross-section of the tunnel is an equilateral triangle with side length $\\sqrt{6^2 + 6^2 + 6^2} = 6\\sqrt{3}$, so its area is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} (6\\sqrt{3})^2 = 27\\sqrt{3}$. The height of the tunnel is 2 (the distance from $E$ to $I$, $J$, or $K$). The lateral surface area of the tunnel is the perimeter of the equilateral triangle times the height of the tunnel, which is $3 \\times 6\\sqrt{3} \\times 2 = 36\\sqrt{3}$. So, the total change in surface area is $27\\sqrt{3} + 36\\sqrt{3} = 63\\sqrt{3}$. Therefore, the surface area of $S$ is $384 - (6\\sqrt{3})^2 + 63\\sqrt{3} = 384 - 108 + 63\\sqrt{3} = 276 + 63\\sqrt{3}$. So, $m = 276$, $n = 63$, and $p = 3$. Hence, $m + n + p = 276 + 63 + 3 = 342$.\n\nLet's write the Python code to verify this calculation:\n\n```python\n# Define the side length of the cube\nside_length = 8\n\n# Calculate the original surface area of the cube\noriginal_surface_area = 6 * side_length**2\n\n# Calculate the area of the equilateral triangle cross-section of the tunnel\ncross_section_area = (3**0.5 / 4) * (6 * (3**0.5))**2\n\n# Calculate the lateral surface area of the tunnel\ntunnel_lateral_surface_area = 3 * (6 * (3**0.5)) * 2\n\n# Calculate the new surface area of the solid S\nnew_surface_area = original_surface_area - cross_section_area + tunnel_lateral_surface_area\n\n# Extract m, n, and p from the new surface area\nm = int(new_surface_area // 1)\nn = int((new_surface_area - m) / (3**0.5))\np = 3\n\n# Calculate m + n + p\nresult = m + n + p\nprint(result)\n```\n```output\n420\n```\nIt appears there was an error in the extraction of the values for \\(m\\), \\(n\\), and \\(p\\) from the new surface area.
