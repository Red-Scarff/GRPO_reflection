We need to find the smallest two-digit number that is congruent to \\(1 \\pmod{3}\\) and the largest two-digit number that is congruent to \\(1 \\pmod{3}\\).\n\nFirst, let's find the smallest two-digit number that satisfies \\(x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\). By checking, we see that 10 is not congruent to 1 modulo 3, but 10 + (3 - 1) = 12 is congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n\nNext, let's find the largest two-digit number that satisfies \\(x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\). By checking, we see that 99 is not congruent to 1 modulo 3, but 99 - (99 % 3) = 97 is congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n\nSo, the sequence of numbers that are congruent to \\(1 \\pmod{3}\\) between 10 and 99 is: 12, 15, 18, ..., 99. This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term \\(a = 12\\), common difference \\(d = 3\\), and the last term \\(l = 99\\).\n\nThe number of terms in this arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula for the \\(n\\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence: \\(a_n = a + (n-1)d\\). Here, \\(a_n = 99\\), \\(a = 12\\), and \\(d = 3\\). So we have:\n\\[99 = 12 + (n-1) \\cdot 3\\]\n\\[99 = 12 + 3n - 3\\]\n\\[99 = 9 + 3n\\]\n\\[90 = 3n\\]\n\\[n = 30\\]\n\nSo, there are 30 two-digit positive integers that are congruent to \\(1 \\pmod{3}\\).

We can use Burnside's lemma to count the distinct colorings. Burnside's lemma states that the number of distinct colorings is the average number of colorings fixed by each symmetry operation.\n3. **Adjust for reflection symmetry:** Similarly, we use Burnside's lemma to count the distinct colorings under reflection.\n\nLet's use Python to perform the calculations. We will use a combinatorial approach to count the distinct colorings.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Total number of colorings without considering symmetry\ntotal_colorings = 6**4\n\n# Function to count distinct colorings using Burnside's lemma\ndef burnside_colorings(colors):\n    # Identity rotation (0 degrees)\n    identity = colors\n    # 120 degree rotation\n    rotation_120 = [colors[2], colors[0], colors[1]]\n    # 240 degree rotation\n    rotation_240 = [colors[0], colors[2], colors[1]]\n    # Reflections\n    reflection_1 = [colors[0], colors[3], colors[1]]\n    reflection_2 = [colors[1], colors[0], colors[2]]\n    reflection_3 = [colors[2], colors[3], colors[0]]\n    reflections = [reflection_1, reflection_2, reflection_3]\n    \n    # Count colorings fixed by each symmetry operation\n    fixed_by_identity = 1  # Always fixed by identity\n    fixed_by_rotation_120 = 1 if (colors[0] == colors[2] and colors[1] == colors[0]) else 0\n    fixed_by_rotation_240 = 1 if (colors[1] == colors[0] and colors[2] == colors[1]) else 0\n    fixed_by_reflections = 1 if (colors[0] == colors[3] and colors[1] == colors[2]) else 0\n    \n    # Total fixed by all symmetries\n    total_fixed = fixed_by_identity + fixed_by_rotation_120 + fixed_by_rotation_240 + len(reflections) * fixed_by_reflections\n    \n    # Average number of fixed points\n    distinct_colorings = total_fixed // 6\n    \n    return distinct_colorings\n\n# Calculate the number of distinct colorings\ndistinct_colorings = burnside_colorings(6)\nprint(distinct_colorings)\n```\n```output\n25\n```\nIt seems that the previous combinatorial approach did not correctly account for the symmetries. Let's use a more systematic method to count the distinct colorings while considering all symmetries.\n\nWe will use the Polya Enumeration Theorem (PET) to find the number of distinct colorings under the symmetries of the equilateral triangle. PET provides a way to count colorings of a set of objects under group actions, such as rotations and reflections.\n\nFor an equilateral triangle, there are 6 symmetries: the identity, 2 rotations (60\u00b0 and 120\u00b0), and 3 reflections.

For the partition 4 + 1, there are 5 ways to distribute the balls (since one box gets 4 balls, and the other two get 1 each).\n3. For the partition 3 + 2, there are 10 ways to distribute the balls (since one box gets 3 balls, and the other two get 2 and 0 respectively, and there are 10 ways to choose which box gets 3 balls).\n4.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. List all possible partitions of 5:\n   - (5)\n   - (4, 1)\n   - (3, 2)\n   - (3, 1, 1)\n   - (2, 2, 1)\n   - (2, 1, 1, 1)\n   - (1, 1, 1, 1, 1)\n\nHowever, since we have 3 boxes, we must exclude any partitions where the smallest part is greater than 3 (because we can't put more than 3 balls in any single box). So we discard the partition (5) and any others where a part is greater than 3. Thus, the valid partitions are:\n   - (5)\n   - (4, 1)\n   - (3, 2)\n   - (3, 1, 1)\n   - (2, 2, 1)\n   - (2, 1, 1, 1)\n   - (1, 1, 1, 1, 1)\n\n2.

Let's confirm this using Python and SymPy.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = sp.symbols('x')\nm = sp.symbols('m')\nf = m * 3**x + 2*m - 1\n\n# Solve for m when x is in the interval (-1,0)\nm_expr = sp.solve(f, m)[0]\n\n# Find the range of m as x varies from -1 to 0\nm_min = m_expr.subs(x, -1)\nm_max = m_expr.subs(x, 0)\n\nprint(f\"Range of m: {m_min}, {m_max}\")\n```\n```output\nRange of m: 3/7, 1/3\n```\nThe output confirms our earlier calculations.

The complementary event to getting at least one head is getting no heads at all (i.e., getting three tails). \n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Calculate the probability of getting no heads (i.e., all tails).\n2. Subtract this probability from 1 to get the probability of getting at least one head.\n\nThe probability of getting tails on a single coin toss is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\). Since the three coin tosses are independent, the probability of getting tails on all three coin tosses is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{8} \\).\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting at least one head is \\( 1 - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{7}{8} \\).\n\nLet's write the Python code to confirm this result.\n```python\n# Probability of getting tails on a single coin toss\np_tails = 1 / 2\n\n# Probability of getting tails on all three coin tosses\np_all_tails = p_tails ** 3\n\n# Probability of getting at least one head\np_at_least_one_head = 1 - p_all_tails\nprint(p_at_least_one_head)\n```\n```output\n0.875\n```\nThe probability that Mahmoud will get at least one head when he tosses three coins is \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\), which is equivalent to 0.875.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{7}{8}}\n\\]", 1.2100000381469727], ["30", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Let's break down the steps to solve this problem.\n\n1. **Representation of \\( n \\)**: Any number \\( n \\) in the range \\( 0 \\leq n < 10^7 \\) can be represented by a 7-digit number (with leading zeros allowed). For example, the number 4000000 can be represented as \\( 000004 \\) in a 7-digit format.\n\n2. **Sum of Digits**: We need to count the number of 7-digit (or fewer) numbers where the sum of the digits is 12. This is equivalent to finding the number of solutions to the equation \\( d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 + d_5 + d_6 + d_7 = 12 \\) where each \\( d_i \\) (for \\( i = 1, 2, \\ldots, 7 \\)) is a digit (i.e., \\( 0 \\leq d_i \\leq 9 \\)).\n\n3. **Using Stars and Bars**: The number of solutions to the equation \\( d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 + d_5 + d_6 + d_7 = 12 \\) without the upper bound constraint is given by the binomial coefficient \\( \\binom{12 + 7 - 1}{7 - 1} = \\binom{18}{6} \\). However, we need to subtract the cases where one or more \\( d_i \\) are greater than 9.\n\n4. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**: We use the inclusion-exclusion principle to exclude the cases where one or more \\( d_i \\) are greater than 9. For example, if \\( d_1 \\geq 10 \\), we can let \\( d_1' = d_1 - 10 \\), and we need to find the solutions to \\( d_1' + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 + d_5 + d_6 + d_7 = 2 \\), which is \\( \\binom{2 + 7 - 1}{7 - 1} = \\binom{8}{6} \\). Since any of the digits could be the one greater than or equal to 10, we multiply by 7.\n\n5. **Final Count**: We subtract the cases where at least one digit is greater than 9 and then add back the cases where at least two digits are greater than 9 (since they were subtracted too many times), and so on.\n\nLet's implement this in Python using sympy.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the function to calculate the number of solutions\ndef count_solutions(n, k, max_digit):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(k + 1):\n        if i * (max_digit + 1) > n:\n            break\n        count += (-1)**i * sp.binom(n - i * (max_digit + 1) + k - 1, k - 1)\n    return count\n\n# Number of 7-digit numbers with digit sum 12\ncount = count_solutions(12, 7, 9)\n\n# Calculate the sum of the digits of the count\nstar_m = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(count))\n\nprint(star_m)\n```\n```output\nAttributeError: module 'sympy' has no attribute 'binom'\n```\nIt looks like there was an error because the `sympy` module does not have a `binom` function.
