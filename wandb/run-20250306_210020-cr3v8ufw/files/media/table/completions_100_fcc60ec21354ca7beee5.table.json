Substituting into the functional equation:\n   \\[\n   (ax + b)(ay + b) = ax + b + ay + b + a(xy) + b - 2 \\implies a^2xy + abx + aby + b^2 = ax + ay + a(xy) + 2b - 2\n   \\]\n   By comparing coefficients, we get:\n   \\[\n   a^2 = a, \\quad ab = a, \\quad ab = a, \\quad b^2 = 2b - 2\n   \\]\n   From $a^2 = a$, we get $a = 0$ or $a = 1$. If $a = 0$, then $b^2 = 2b - 2$, which simplifies to $b^2 - 2b + 2 = 0$, and this has no real solutions. Therefore, $a = 1$. Substituting $a = 1$ into $ab = a$, we get $b = 1$. And substituting into $b^2 = 2b - 2$, we get $1 = 2 - 2$, which is true. So, $p(x) = x + 1$.

Find the units digit of the resulting sum.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. The units digits of the squares of odd numbers repeat every 10 numbers. The units digits of the squares of the first 10 odd numbers are: \\(1^2 = 1\\), \\(3^2 = 9\\), \\(5^2 = 25\\) (units digit is 5), \\(7^2 = 49\\) (units digit is 9), \\(9^2 = 81\\) (units digit is 1).

Since \\( \\angle BAD = \\angle BAC + \\angle DAC \\) and \\( \\angle BAC = 60^\\circ \\), we can use the fact that \\( \\angle BAD = 30^\\circ + x \\) where \\( x \\) is the measure of \\( \\angle DAC \\). Because \\( \\angle BAD \\) is part of the straight line with \\( \\angle BCA \\), we have \\( \\angle BAD = 180^\\circ - 90^\\circ - 30^\\circ = 60^\\circ \\). Therefore, \\( 30^\\circ + x = 60^\\circ \\), so \\( x = 30^\\circ \\).\n\nThus, the measure of angle \\( \\angle CAD \\) is \\( 30^\\circ \\).\n\nLet's confirm this with a bit of Python code to ensure the result is accurate. We can use the sympy library to handle the geometric calculations.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the angles\nangle_BAC = 60  # Angle of the equilateral triangle\nangle_BCD = 90  # Angle of the square\n\n# Calculate angle BCA\nangle_BCA = angle_BCD - angle_BAC\n\n# Since angle BAD = angle BAC + angle DAC and angle BAD = 60 degrees (from the straight line with BCA)\nangle_BAD = 60\n\n# Therefore, angle DAC = angle_BAD - angle_BAC\nangle_DAC = angle_BAD - angle_BAC\n\nprint(angle_DAC)\n```\n```output\n0\n```\nIt seems there was an error in the code logic. Let's re-evaluate the problem and correct the approach.\n\nWe need to find the measure of angle \\( \\angle CAD \\). We know:\n1. \\( \\angle BAC = 60^\\circ \\) (since \\( \\triangle ABC \\) is an equilateral triangle).\n2. \\( \\angle BCD = 90^\\circ \\) (since \\( BCDE \\) is a square).\n3. \\( \\angle BCA = 90^\\circ - 60^\\circ = 30^\\circ \\) (since \\( \\angle BCA \\) is the angle between the side \\( BC \\) of the square and the side \\( CA \\) of the equilateral triangle).\n\nSince \\( \\angle BAD = \\angle BAC + \\angle DAC \\) and \\( \\angle BAD = 60^\\circ \\), we have \\( 60^\\circ = 60^\\circ + \\angle DAC \\). This means \\( \\angle DAC = 0^\\circ \\), but this is incorrect because we need to consider the geometry correctly.\n\nInstead, let's look at it this way: \\( \\angle BAD = 90^\\circ - 30^\\circ = 60^\\circ \\). Therefore, \\( \\angle DAC = 60^\\circ - 60^\\circ = 0^\\circ \\), but this is incorrect because we need to consider the geometry correctly.\n\nThe correct approach is to realize that \\( \\angle BAD = \\angle BAC + \\angle DAC = 60^\\circ \\), and since \\( \\angle BAC = 60^\\circ \\), \\( \\angle DAC \\) must be the remaining angle, which is \\( 30^\\circ \\).\n\nLet's correct the code to reflect this understanding:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the angles\nangle_BAC = 60  # Angle of the equilateral triangle\nangle_BCD = 90  # Angle of the square\nangle_BCA = angle_BCD - angle_B", 0.38999998569488525], ["55", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

So, \\( \\angle CAD = 90^\\circ - 60^\\circ = 30^\\circ \\).\n\nLet's confirm this with Python and sympy:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the coordinates\na = sp.Symbol('a')\nB = (0, 0)\nC = (a, 0)\nA = (a/2, sp.sqrt(3)*a/2)\nD = (a, -a)\n\n# Calculate the slopes\nslope_AC = (A[1] - C[1]) / (A[0] - C[0])\nslope_CD = (D[1] - C[1]) / (D[0] - C[0])\n\n# Calculate the angle between AC and CD\ntan_theta = sp.Abs((slope_CD - slope_AC) / (1 + slope_AC * slope_CD))\nangle_rad = sp.atan(tan_theta)\nangle_deg = sp.deg(angle_rad)\n\nprint(angle_deg)\n```\n```output\nZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n```\nThe error indicates that there was a division by zero, which occurred because the slope of \\( CD \\) is undefined (since it is a vertical line). We need to handle this case separately. As mentioned earlier, the angle between a line with slope \\( -\\sqrt{3} \\) and a vertical line is \\( 60^\\circ \\), and since \\( CD \\) is vertical, the angle \\( \\angle CAD \\) is \\( 90^\\circ - 60^\\circ = 30^\\circ \\).\n\nTo verify this, let's use geometric reasoning directly without calculating the slopes. Since \\( AC \\) makes an angle of \\( 60^\\circ \\) with the horizontal and \\( CD \\) is vertical, the angle \\( \\angle CAD \\) is simply \\( 90^\\circ - 60^\\circ", 0.47999998927116394], ["55", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

First, we note that triangle $ABC$ is an equilateral triangle. Each internal angle of an equilateral triangle is $60^\\circ$. So, $\\angle BAC = 60^\\circ$.\n2. Next, we consider the square $BCDE$. Each internal angle of a square is $90^\\circ$. So, $\\angle BCE = 90^\\circ$.\n3. Now, we need to find the measure of angle $CAD$. We know that $\\angle BAC = 60^\\circ$ and $\\angle BCE = 90^\\circ$. To find $\\angle CAD$, we need to consider the position of point $D$ and the line segment $CD$.\n\nSince $D$ is directly below $B$ and $E$ is directly below $C$, we can see that $\\angle CBD = 90^\\circ$. Therefore, $\\angle CAD$ can be found by subtracting the internal angles of triangle $ABC$ and square $BCDE$ from the full $360^\\circ$ around point $C$.\n\nWe can use the following steps to find the measure of angle $CAD$:\n1. Calculate the remaining angle around point $C$ after accounting for $\\angle BAC$ and $\\angle BCD$.\n2. Add the small angle formed by line segment $CD$ and the horizontal line through $C$.\n\nLet's break it down mathematically:\n\n\\[\n\\angle CAD = 360^\\circ - (\\angle BAC + \\angle BCD + \\angle BCE)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\angle CAD = 360^\\circ - (60^\\circ + 90^\\circ + 90^\\circ)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\angle CAD = 360^\\circ - 240^\\circ = 120^\\circ\n\\]\n\nHowever, we need to correct for the fact that we are looking for the internal angle at point $A$ in the triangle $CAD$. The correct measure of angle $CAD$ is:\n\n\\[\n\\angle CAD = 180^\\circ - (\\angle BAC + \\angle BCE) = 180^\\circ - (60^\\circ + 90^\\circ) = 30^\\circ\n\\]\n\nBut since we need the internal angle at point $C$, we need to subtract the small angle formed by line segment $CD$ and the horizontal line through $C$:\n\n\\[\n\\angle CAD = 180^\\circ - (60^\\circ + 90^\\circ - 90^\\circ) = 30^\\circ\n\\]\n\nSo the correct measure of angle $CAD$ is:\n\n\\[\n\\angle CAD = 180^\\circ - 60^\\circ - (90^\\circ - 45^\\circ) = 180^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 45^\\circ = 75^\\circ\n\\]\n\nBut this is not correct either. The correct measure should be calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\angle CAD = 180^\\circ - (60^\\circ + 90^\\circ) = 30^\\circ\n\\]\n\nFinally, we can use the following Python code to verify the calculation:\n```python\n# Define the angles\nangle_BAC = 60  # Angle BAC in degrees\nangle_BCD = 90  # Angle BCD in degrees (part of the square)\nangle_BCE = 90  # Angle BCE in degrees (part of the square)\n\n# Calculate the angle CAD\nangle_CAD = 180 - (angle_BAC + angle_BCD)\n\nprint(angle_CAD)\n```\n```output\n30\n```\nThe correct measure of the angle $CAD$ is \\(\\boxed{75}\\) degrees.", 0.20999999344348907]]}
