For any meeting, a chairperson is chosen randomly from the board, and then the three highest-ranking people (the two vice-chairs and the first secretary-treasurer) are also chosen randomly from the remaining board members. What is the probability that the chairperson is a woman and at least one of the vice-chairs is a man?\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that the chairperson is a woman and at least one of the vice-chairs is a man. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of ways to choose the chairperson, vice-chairs, and first secretary-treasurer:**\n   - The chairperson can be chosen in 12 ways (since there are 12 members).\n   - After choosing the chairperson, there are 11 remaining members. The vice-chairs can be chosen in \\(11 \\times 10\\) ways (since we choose 2 out of the remaining 11 members and assign them to the vice-chairs).\n   - After choosing the chairperson and the vice-chairs, there are 9 remaining members. The first secretary-treasurer can be chosen in 9 ways.\n   - So, the total number of ways to choose the chairperson, vice-chairs, and first secretary-treasurer is \\(12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the number of favorable outcomes:**\n   - The chairperson must be a woman. There are 6 choices for the chairperson.\n   - After choosing the chairperson, there are 10 remaining members. We need to choose 2 vice-chairs such that at least one of them is a man. The possible scenarios are:\n     - Case 1: Both vice-chairs are men. There are \\(5 \\times 4\\) ways to choose the two vice-chairs (since we choose 2 out of the remaining 5 men).\n     - Case 2: One of the vice-chairs is a man and the other is a woman. There are \\(5 \\times 6 + 6 \\times 5 = 60\\) ways to choose the vice-chairs (since we choose 1 man out of 5 and 1 woman out of 6, and vice versa).\n   - The first secretary-treasurer can be chosen in 9 ways from the remaining 9 members.\n   - So, the number of favorable outcomes is \\(6 \\times (5 \\times 4 + 60) \\times 9\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the probability:**\n   - The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of ways to choose the chairperson, vice-chairs, and first secretary-treasurer.\n\nLet's implement this in Python using sympy to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Total number of ways to choose the chairperson, vice-chairs, and first secretary-treasurer\ntotal_ways = 12 * 11 * 10 * 9\n\n# Number of favorable outcomes\n# Chairperson is a woman (6 choices)\n# Choose 2 vice-chairs such that at least one is a man\n# Case 1: Both vice-chairs are men (5 * 4 ways)\n# Case 2: One of the vice-chairs is a man and the other is a woman (5 * 6 + 6 * 5 = 60 ways)\nfavorable_ways = 6 * (5 * 4 + 60) * 9\n\n# Probability\nprobability = sp.Rational", 0.30000001192092896], ["20", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Let's start with $y = 12$ (we can check $y = -12$ later if needed).\n\n2. **Condition 2: Distance from the point $(1, 6)$ is 10 units.**\n   Using the distance formula, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + (12 - 6)^2} = 10\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the above equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + 36} = 10\n   \\]\n   Squaring both sides, we get:\n   \\[\n   (x - 1)^2 + 36 = 100\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (x - 1)^2 = 64\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x - 1 = 8 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x - 1 = -8\n   \\]\n   Since $x > 1$, we have:\n   \\[\n   x - 1 = 8 \\implies x = 9\n   \\]\n   So, the point is $(9, 12)$.\n\n3. **Condition 3: Distance from the origin.**\n   Using the distance formula, we have:\n   \\[\n   n = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \\sqrt{9^2 + 12^2} = \\sqrt{81 + 144} = \\sqrt{225} = 15\n   \\]\n\nLet's verify the other case where $y = -12$. We already have:\n\\[\n(x - 1)^2 + 36 = 100 \\implies (x - 1)^2 = 64 \\implies x - 1 = 8 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x - 1 = -8\n\\]\nAgain, since $x > 1$, we have:\n\\[\nx = 9\n\\]\nSo, the point is $(9, -12)$, and the distance from the origin is the same:\n\\[\nn = \\sqrt{9^2 + (-12)^2} = \\sqrt{81 + 144} = \\sqrt{225} = 15\n\\]\n\nThus, the distance $n$ from the origin is $\\boxed{15}$.

Here's the plan:\n\n1. First, we need to find all \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = y \\) where \\( f(y) = -3 \\).\n2. Then, for each \\( y \\), we need to find all \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = y \\).\n3. Finally, we need to sum up all the distinct \\( x \\) values that satisfy \\( f(f(f(x))) = -3 \\).\n\nLet's start by finding where \\( f(x) = -3 \\). The quadratic function \\( f(x) = \\frac{x^2}{4} + x - 3 \\) can be rewritten as \\( \\frac{x^2 + 4x - 12}{4} = -3 \\).

So, \\( x = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 48}}{2} = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{64}}{2} = \\frac{-4 \\pm 8}{2} \\). This gives us \\( x = 2 \\) or \\( x = -6 \\).\n\n2.

The minimum value is \\( f(-2) = -4 \\). The function \\( f(x) \\) can be written in vertex form as \\( f(x) = a(x + 2)^2 - 4 \\). Given that the vertex form of a quadratic function is \\( f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k \\), we have \\( h = -2 \\) and \\( k = -4 \\).

His cafe is open from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. In the first hour, 5 customers order the 3 egg omelettes. In the second hour, 7 customers order the 4 egg omelettes. In the third hour, 3 customers order the 3 egg omelettes. In the last hour, 8 customers order the 4 egg omelettes. Additionally, if there's a holiday, each customer orders an extra egg. Considering there are 2 holidays in a month, how many eggs does Theo need to make all the omelettes in a month, assuming there are 4 weeks in a month? To determine how many eggs Theo needs in a month, we need to calculate the total number of eggs used in a week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a month, taking into account the additional eggs needed on the holidays.\n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of eggs used in a day.\n2. Multiply by the number of days in a week (7).\n3. Multiply by the number of weeks in a month (4).\n4. Add the extra eggs needed on the holidays.\n\nWe'll start by calculating the total number of eggs used in a day. Each day is divided into 4 hours, and we have four categories of customers: 3 egg omelettes, 4 egg omelettes, 3 egg omelettes, and 4 egg omelettes. Let's denote the total number of customers ordering each type of omelette in a day as follows:\n- \\(3 \\text{ egg omelettes in the first hour} = 5\\)\n- \\(4 \\text{ egg omelettes in the second hour} = 7\\)\n- \\(3 \\text{ egg omelettes in the third hour} = 3\\)\n- \\(4 \\text{ egg omelettes in the fourth hour} = 8\\)\n\nThe total number of eggs used in a day is then:\n\\[ \\text{Total eggs in a day} = (5 \\times 3) + (7 \\times 4) + (3 \\times 3) + (8 \\times 4) \\]\n\nNext, we need to account for the extra eggs needed on holidays. If each customer orders an extra egg on a holiday, we need to add an additional egg for each customer. Since each category of customers orders an extra egg on each holiday, we need to multiply the total number", 1.3899999856948853], ["20", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.
