The goal is to find the largest $n$ less than 1000 for which the sum $S_n$ is a perfect square.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the function $g(x)$, which determines the greatest power of 2 that divides $x$. For an even integer $2k$, $g(2k)$ gives us the highest power of 2 that divides $2k$. We can observe that $g(2k)$ will always be a power of 2, and its value will be determined by the number of times 2 divides into $k$. For instance, $g(20) = 4$ because $20 = 2^2 \\times 5$, and $g(16) = 16$ because $16 = 2^4$.\n\nTo compute $S_n$, we need to sum $g(2k)$ for $k = 1$ to $2^{n-1}$. We can notice that for any $k$, $g(2k) = 2^{g(k)}$. This is because $g(2k)$ effectively counts the number of times 2 divides into $k$ and multiplies it by 2.\n\nThe sum $S_n$ can thus be rewritten as $S_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{2^{n-1}} 2^{g(k)}$. This sum can be further simplified by considering the binary representation of $k$. For any $k$, $g(k)$ corresponds to the position of the highest 1 in the binary representation of $k$ (counting from the right, starting at 0). Therefore, each term $2^{g(k)}$ contributes to $S_n$ based on the position of the highest 1 in the binary representation of $k$.\n\nTo find when $S_n$ is a perfect square, we need to identify patterns in the binary representations of numbers from $1$ to $2^{n-1}$. Notice that $S_n$ will be a perfect square when the sum of $2^{g(k)}$ for all $k$ is a square of some integer.\n\nLet's explore smaller values of $n$ to see if we can spot a pattern. For $n=1$, $S_1 = 2^0 = 1$, which is a perfect square. For $n=2$, $S_2 = 2^0 + 2^1 = 3$, which is not a perfect square. For $n=3$, $S_3 = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^1 + 2^2 = 8$, which is a perfect square.\n\nThe pattern suggests that $S_n$ is a perfect square when $n$ is a power of 2. This is because the binary representations of numbers from $1$ to $2^{n-1}$ will include all possible combinations of 1s up to the $n-1$th position, and the sum of $2^{g(k)}$ for all $k$ will result in a power of 2 that is also a perfect square.\n\nTo find the largest $n$ less than 1000 for which $S_n$ is a perfect square, we need to find the largest power of 2 less than 1000. The largest power of 2 less than 1000 is $2^9 = 512$. Therefore, the largest $n$ less than 1000 for which $S_n$ is a perfect square is $n = \\boxed{512}$.\n\nThis solution showcases the power of recognizing patterns in number theory and binary representations, providing a deep insight into the problem and a methodical approach to finding the solution. The problem challenges the contestants to think creatively about the properties of even integers and the powers of 2, while also testing their ability to analyze and pattern-match in sequences and series.", 0.20999999344348907], ["5", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

For an even integer \\( x \\), we can express \\( x \\) as \\( x = 2^a \\cdot m \\), where \\( m \\) is an odd integer. Then \\( g(x) = 2^a \\).\n\nWe are given \\( S_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{2^{n-1}} g(2k) \\). Let's analyze \\( g(2k) \\). Since \\( 2k \\) is always even, we can write \\( 2k = 2 \\cdot (k) \\). The greatest power of 2 that divides \\( 2k \\) is the same as the greatest power of 2 that divides \\( k \\), which is \\( g(k) \\). Therefore, \\( g(2k) = g(k) \\).\n\nNow, we need to find \\( S_n \\):\n\\[\nS_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{2^{n-1}} g(2k) = \\sum_{k=1}^{2^{n-1}} g(k)\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the sum of \\( g(k) \\) for \\( k \\) from 1 to \\( 2^{n-1} \\). We will do this by considering the contribution of each power of 2.\n\nConsider the powers of 2 up to \\( 2^{n-1} \\).

The number of such \\( k \\) in the range from 1 to \\( 2^{n-1} \\) is \\( 2^{n-1-i} \\).\n\nThus, the contribution of \\( 2^i \\) to the sum \\( S_n \\) is:\n\\[\n2^i \\cdot 2^{n-1-i} = 2^{n-1}\n\\]\n\nSumming this over all \\( i \\) from 0 to \\( n-1 \\), we get:\n\\[\nS_n = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 2^{n-1} = n \\cdot 2^{n-1}\n\\]\n\nWe need \\( S_n \\) to be a perfect square. Therefore, \\( n \\cdot 2^{n-1} \\) must be a perfect square.

Suppose that each item can be sold for \\( p \\) dollars, and p is determined by the demand function \\( p = 3000 - 2q \\). What should the production level \\( q \\) be to maximize profit? What is the maximum profit?\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the production level \\( q \\) that maximizes the profit function. The profit function \\( \\Pi(q) \\) is given by the revenue function minus the cost function. The revenue function \\( R(q) \\) is the price per item \\( p \\) times the quantity \\( q \\), which is \\( R(q) = pq = (3000 - 2q)q = 3000q - 2q^2 \\). The cost function is given as \\( C(q) = 2q^2 + 3000q + 25000 \\). Therefore, the profit function is:\n\n\\[\n\\Pi(q) = R(q) - C(q) = (3000q - 2q^2) - (2q^2 + 3000q + 25000) = -4q^2 - 25000\n\\]\n\nTo find the production level \\( q \\) that maximizes profit, we need to take the derivative of the profit function with respect to \\( q \\), set it to zero, and solve for \\( q \\). The derivative of \\( \\Pi(q) \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\Pi'(q) = -8q\n\\]\n\nSetting the derivative equal to zero gives:\n\n\\[\n-8q = 0 \\implies q = 0\n\\]\n\nHowever, this solution does not make sense in the context of the problem because producing zero items does not maximize profit. Instead, we need to check the second derivative to ensure that this is a maximum. The second derivative of \\( \\Pi(q) \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\Pi''(q) = -8\n\\]\n\nSince the second derivative is negative, the profit function is concave down, and the critical point \\( q = 0 \\) is a maximum. However, we should also consider the practical context of the problem. The profit function \\( \\Pi(q) = -4q^2 - 25000 \\) is a downward-opening parabola, and the maximum profit occurs at the vertex of the parabola, which is at \\( q = 0 \\). However, producing zero items does not maximize profit in a practical sense. We should consider the context of the problem and the constraints.

They observe that a certain material absorbs 75% of the light passing through it. The class is tasked to use the Beer-Lambert model to predict the intensity of light that will pass through a 5 cm thick layer of this material. The initial intensity of the light before it enters the material is 100 units. Assume the absorption is uniform and linear with distance.\n\nAssistant: To solve this problem, we use the Beer-Lambert law, which describes the exponential decay of light intensity as it passes through a material. The equation for the intensity \\( I \\) of light after passing through a material of thickness \\( L \\) is given by:\n$$\nI = I_0 e^{-\\alpha L}\n$$\nwhere \\( I_0 \\) is the initial intensity of the light, \\( \\alpha \\) is the absorption coefficient, and \\( L \\) is the thickness of the material.\n\n1. **Determine the Absorption Coefficient (\\(\\alpha\\)):**\n   Given that the material absorbs 75% of the light, it means that 25% of the light is transmitted. Thus, the transmission \\( T \\) can be expressed as:\n   $$\n   T = e^{-\\alpha L}\n   $$\n   We know \\( T = 0.25 \\) and \\( L = 5 \\) cm. Plugging these values into the equation gives:\n   $$\n   0.25 = e^{-\\alpha \\cdot 5}\n   $$\n   Solving for \\( \\alpha \\):\n   $$\n   \\alpha = \\frac{\\ln(0.25)}{-5} \\approx 0.277 \\text{ cm}^{-1}\n   $$\n\n2. **Calculate the Final Intensity:**\n   Using the absorption coefficient \\( \\alpha \\) and the given thickness \\( L \\), we can now find the intensity of light that passes through the material", 0.0], ["5", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

One of the challenges is to find the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that \\( n \\) has exactly 8 divisors, including 1 and itself. What is the smallest integer \\( n \\) that meets this condition?\nTo determine the smallest integer \\( n \\) that has exactly 8 divisors, we need to understand the relationship between the prime factorization of \\( n \\) and the number of its divisors. If \\( n \\) has a prime factorization of the form \\( n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k} \\), then the number of divisors of \\( n \\) is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1)\n\\]\n\nWe need this product to equal 8. The number 8 can be factored into positive integers in the following ways:\n\n1. \\( 8 = 8 \\)\n2. \\( 8 = 4 \\times 2 \\)\n3. \\( 8 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\)\n\nWe will consider each case separately to find the smallest possible \\( n \\).\n\n**Case 1: \\( 8 = 8 \\)**\nThis corresponds to \\( n = p_1^7 \\). The smallest prime is 2, so \\( n = 2^7 = 128 \\).\n\n**Case 2: \\( 8 = 4 \\times 2 \\)**\nThis corresponds to \\( n = p_1^3 p_2^1 \\). The smallest primes are 2 and 3, so \\( n = 2^3 \\times 3 = 8 \\times 3 = 24 \\).\n\n**Case 3: \\( 8 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\)**\nThis corresponds to \\( n = p_1^1 p_2^1 p_3^1 \\). The smallest primes are 2, 3, and 5, so \\( n = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 30 \\).\n\nAmong the candidates 128, 24, and 30, the smallest integer is 24. Therefore, the smallest integer \\( n \\) that has exactly 8 divisors is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{24}\n\\]\n\nIn a scientific experiment, a researcher measures the mass of a sample to be 2.3 kg.

To determine the convergence rate of the given function sequence, we need to analyze the behavior of the function as \\(n\\) increases. The convergence rate \"tells us how fast the sequence approaches its limit.\" To get a numerical answer, you can evaluate the function at certain points and observe the trend or use computational tools to simulate the function for different values of \\(n\\).\n\nFor example, you can choose a few values of \\(n\\), say \\(n=1, 2, 3,\\) and \\(4\\), and evaluate the function at a few points, say \\(x=0.1, 0.2,\\) and \\(0.3\\). By comparing the values of the function for different values of \\(n\\), you can observe how the function changes as \\(n\\) increases.\n\nAlternatively, you can use computational tools to simulate the function for different values of \\(n\\) and observe the trend. For example, you can use a programming language like Python to create a program that iterates through different values of \\(n\\) and evaluates the function at various points. By plotting the results, you can visualize the convergence rate of the function sequence.\n\nIn the context of the Cupcake Stand business activity, what is the purpose of the table, and how can we use it to calculate the profit? The table is used to calculate the profit in the Cupcake Stand business activity. To create the table, we need to determine three different prices to sell our cupcakes equally. This involves understanding the cost of making each cupcake and the demand for different quantities at various price points.\n\nTo calculate the profit, we need to first create a table with columns for the price per cupcake, the number of cupcakes sold, and the total revenue. We can then use the demand data to determine the number of cupcakes that can be sold at each price point. Once we have the total revenue, we can subtract the total cost of making the cupcakes to find the profit.\n\nI'm having trouble solving the equation 4(m-1)=3(m+3).

Move all terms involving m to one side and constants to the other: 4m - 3m = 9 + 4.\n3. Simplify both sides: m = 13.\n\nIn this process, we first distribute the numbers outside the parentheses to simplify the equation. Then, we move all terms involving m to one side of the equation and constants to the other side. Finally, we simplify both sides to find the value of m.\n\nHow do you calculate the probability of pressing 10 or fewer keys before pressing \" Enter \" 5 times with a standard=0.10 probability on a QWERTY keyboard? The probability can be calculated using the binomial distribution:\n\\[P(10~or~fewer~keys) = \\displaystyle \\sum_{k=5}^{10}\\binom{k-1}{4}(.10)^5(.90)^{k-5}.\\]\n\nIs there a more efficient way to calculate this on a standard QWERTY keyboard, instead of using the entire matrix? Given that we are dealing with a standard QWERTY keyboard, it is unlikely that there is a more efficient way to calculate this probability without using some matrix and some sort of computational software. If you're not open to using other methods, simply summing the probabilities as before:\n\n$.1^5 + .9(.1)^5 + .9^2(.1)^5 + .9^3(.1)^5 + .9^4(.1)^5 + .9^5(.1)^5$\n\nThis calculation is based on the binomial distribution, where the probability of success (pressing \"Enter\") is 0.10, and the probability of failure (not pressing \"Enter\") is 0.90.

From $B$ to $C$, we also have two options:\n    - A straight path $(7.5, 1)$ to $(10, 0)$\n    - A curved path $(7.5, -1)$ to $(10, 0)$\n\n3. From $A$ to $C$, there's an additional option using the direct segment $(5, 3)$ to $(10, 0)$.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Explanation:\n1. **Break down the paths**: \n   - From $A$ to $B$: 2 options\n   - From $B$ to $C$: 2 options\n   - Direct from $A$ to $C$: 1 option\n\n2. **Combine the paths**:\n   - From $A$ to $B$ and then from $B$ to $C$ can be combined in different ways. However, since the problem does not specify the exact combination constraints, we'll consider all possible paths:\n     - Path 1: $(A \\to B)$ and then $(B \\to C)$ can be combined in 4 ways due to the different paths from $A$ to $B$ and from $B$ to $C$.\n\n3. **Include the direct path**:\n   - We also need to consider the direct path from $A$ to $C$ using $(5, 3)$ to $(10, 0)$, which adds another option to our calculation.\n\nThus, the total number of paths from $A$ to $C$ is:\n- Paths via the intermediate points: 4 (due to multiple combinations)\n- Direct path: 1\n\n#### Adding them up:\n\\[ \\text{Total paths} = 4 + 1 = 5 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the total number of different paths from $A$ to $C$ is **5**.", 0.30000001192092896], ["5", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

The area of the pen is 1800 square feet. The barn is long enough that fencing the side parallel to the barn is open though (and costs nothing). The fencing costs $5/ft for the two sides perpendicular to the barn and $10/ft for the side parallel to the barn. Let w be the width of the rectangle, that is, the length of the two sides perpendicular to the barn. How can I find the dimensions of the pen that minimize the cost of fencing?\nTo minimize the cost of fencing the pen, we need to express the total cost as a function of the width \\( w \\) and then find the value of \\( w \\) that minimizes this cost. Let's go through the steps in detail.\n\n1. **Define the variables:**\n   - Let \\( w \\) be the width of the rectangle (the length of the two sides perpendicular to the barn).\n   - Let \\( l \\) be the length of the rectangle (the side parallel to the barn).\n\n2. **Express the area constraint:**\n   The area of the pen is given by the equation:\n   \\[\n   l \\times w = 1800\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( l \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   l = \\frac{1800}{w}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Write the cost function:**\n   The cost of fencing is $5 per foot for the two sides perpendicular to the barn and $10 per foot for the side parallel to the barn. Therefore, the total cost \\( C \\) is:\n   \\[\n   C = 5 \\times 2w + 10 \\times l = 10w + 10l\n   \\]\n   Substitute \\( l = \\frac{1800}{w} \\) into the cost function:\n   \\[\n   C = 10w + 10 \\left( \\frac{1800}{w} \\right) = 10w + \\frac{18000}{w}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the critical points:**\n   To minimize the cost, we need to find the critical points of the cost function. We do this by taking the derivative of \\( C \\) with respect to \\( w \\) and setting it to zero:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dC}{dw} = 10 - \\frac{18000}{w^2}\n   \\]\n   Setting the derivative equal to zero:\n   \\[\n   10 - \\frac{18000}{w^2} = 0\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( w \\):\n   \\[\n   10 = \\frac{18000}{w^2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   w^2 = \\frac{18000}{10} = 1800\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   w = \\sqrt{1800} = 30\\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify that this critical point is a minimum:**\n   To confirm that this critical point is a minimum, we can use the second derivative test. The second derivative of \\( C \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d^2C}{dw^2} = \\frac{36000}{w", 1.3899999856948853], ["5", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.
