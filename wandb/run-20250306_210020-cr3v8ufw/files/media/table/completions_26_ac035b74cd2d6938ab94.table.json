A fraction terminates if its denominator (after simplification) only has prime factors of 2 and/or 5. This is because the decimal representation terminates if the denominator is a power of 10, and 10 = 2 * 5. \n\nThe key insight is that if $n$ contains the digit 9, $n$ must be divisible by 3 (since a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3, and the only digit in 9 is 9 itself, which is divisible by 3). \n\nNow, we need to find the smallest $n$ that satisfies two conditions: \n1. $n$ contains the digit 9.\n2. $n$ is divisible by 3.\n3. When $\\frac{1}{n}$ is simplified, $n$ only has prime factors of 2 and/or 5 (since we need a terminating decimal).\n\nLet's start by listing the smallest numbers that contain the digit 9 and are divisible by 3. We can skip the numbers that are divisible by 3 because they will not result in a terminating decimal when inverted. The smallest number that fits our criteria is 93 (9 + 3 = 12, which is divisible by 3).\n\nHowever, 93 is not a power of 2 or 5, so $\\frac{1}{93}$ will not terminate. We need to find the next number. \n\nThe next number that contains the digit 9 and is divisible by 3 is 195 (1 + 9 + 5 = 15, which is divisible by 3). However, 195 is not a power of 2 or 5 either.\n\nWe continue this process, checking each number that contains the digit 9 and is divisible by 3, until we find one that is a power of 2 or 5. The next number that fits our criteria is 399 (3 + 9 + 9 = 21, which is divisible by 3). However, 399 is not a power of 2 or 5 either.\n\nThe next number that fits our criteria is 999 (9 + 9 + 9 = 27, which is divisible by 3). This number is a power of 3, but it is not a power of 2 or 5. \n\nThe next number that fits our criteria is 1995 (1 + 9 + 9 + 5 = 24, which is divisible by 3). However, 1995 is not a power of 2 or 5 either.\n\nFinally, we reach 9999, which is a power of 3 and is divisible by 9 (since 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 36, which is divisible by 9). And since it is a power of 3, it will result in a terminating decimal when inverted.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $\\frac{1}{n}$ is a terminating decimal and $n$ contains the digit 9 is $\\boxed{9999}$.", 0.30000001192092896], ["10", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

This is because the decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{n}$ is terminate if $n$ can be expressed in terms of powers of 2 and 5 only, as these are the prime factors of the base 10 system.\n\n2. **Identifying Candidates**: We are looking for the smallest $n$ that contains the digit 9 and is a product of powers of 2 and 5. The smallest such number is 9, but it is not a product of 2s and 5s. The next smallest is 90, which can be expressed as $2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5$. Since we are looking for numbers composed only of 2s and 5s, we need to consider higher powers of 9.\n\n3. **Higher Powers of 9**: We need to find the smallest power of 9 that contains the digit 9 and fits the form $2^a5^b$. The first few powers of 9 are 9, 81, 729, etc. \n\n   - For $9^1 = 9$, the number 9 is indeed a product of 2s and 5s (since $9 = 3^2$).\n   - For $9^2 = 81$, the number 81 is not a product of 2s and 5s.\n   - For $9^3 = 729$, the number 729 is a product of $3^6$, and it does not fit the form $2^a5^b$.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The smallest positive integer $n$ that is a product of powers of 2 and 5, contains the digit 9, and is a terminating decimal is 9. This is because $9 = 3^2$, and we consider the digit 9.
