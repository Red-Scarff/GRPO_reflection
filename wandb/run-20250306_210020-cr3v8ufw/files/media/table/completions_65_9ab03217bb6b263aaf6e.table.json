Let's do this step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse of 100 modulo 101\n\nThe steps of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the inverse of 100 modulo 101 are as follows:\n\n1. Apply the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 101 and 100.\n2. Use the gcd to express 1 as a linear combination of 101 and 100.\n\nLet's perform these steps:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&101 = 100 \\cdot 1 + 1, \\\\\n&100 = 1 \\cdot 100 + 0.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nThe gcd is 1, and we can express 1 as a linear combination of 101 and 100:\n\n\\[\n1 = 101 - 100 \\cdot 1.\n\\]\n\nThis tells us that the modular inverse of 100 modulo 101 is \\(-1\\). Since we need a positive integer between 0 and 100, we take \\(-1 \\mod 101\\) to get \\(100\\).\n\nSo, the modular inverse of 100 modulo 101 is 100. Now we can solve for \\(n\\) by multiplying both sides of the original congruence by 100:\n\n\\[\nn \\equiv 72 \\cdot 100 \\pmod{101}.\n\\]\n\nNow we need to compute \\(72 \\cdot 100 \\mod 101\\):\n\n\\[\n72 \\cdot 100 = 7200.\n\\]\n\nNow we find the remainder when 7200 is divided by 101:\n\n\\[\n7200 \\div 101 = 71 \\text{ remainder } 29.\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(7200 \\equiv 29 \\pmod{101}\\).

To find the linear equation that models the temperature as a function of the number of chirps per minute, we can use the two-point form of the equation of a line.\n\nThe two-point form of the equation of a line that passes through two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is:\n\\[ y - y_1 = \\left[\\frac{(y_2 - y_1)}{(x_2 - x_1)}\\right] * (x - x_1) \\]\n\nGiven (x1, y1) = (116, 70) and (x2, y2) = (177, 80), we can substitute these values into the formula to get:\n\\[ Temperature - 70 = \\left[\\frac{(80 - 70)}{(177 - 116)}\\right] * (Chirps - 116) \\]\n\\[ Temperature - 70 = \\left[\\frac{10}{61}\\right] * (Chirps - 116) \\]\n\\[ Temperature - 70 = \\left[\\frac{10}{61}\\right] * Chirps - \\left[\\frac{10}{61}\\right] * 116 \\]\n\\[ Temperature - 70 = \\left[\\frac{10}{61}\\right] * Chirps - 19 \\]\n\nTherefore, the linear equation that models the temperature as a function of the number of chirps per minute is:\n\\[ Temperature = \\left[\\frac{10}{61}\\right] * Chirps - 19 \\]\n\nConsider three orthogonal unit vectors $\\mathbf{a},$ $\\mathbf{b},$ and $\\mathbf{c}$.

So $\\theta \\in (0, \\pi)$.\n   - At $x = 1$: The expression evaluates to $\\cos \\theta + \\sin \\theta > 0$.
