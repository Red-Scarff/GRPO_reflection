What is the arithmetic mean of these five scores?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "<think>\nOkay, so Jeff's five assignment scores are 89, 92, 88, 95, and 91. I need to find the arithmetic mean of these scores. Hmm, arithmetic mean... right, that's the average, which is calculated by adding up all the numbers and then dividing by how many there are. Let me confirm, arithmetic mean is (sum of all values) divided by the number of values. Yeah, that sounds right.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall how to add up these numbers step by step. Let me list them out: 89, 92, 88, 95, 91. Let's start adding them one by one. Let's take 89 + 92 first. 89 plus 90 is 179, right? Then add the extra 2, so that's 181. Then I have 88 left. So 181 + 88. Hmm, 180 + 80 is 260, and 1 + 8 is 9, so 260 + 9 is 269. Okay, so 89 + 92 + 88 is 269.\n\nNext, add 95 to 269. 269 + 90 is 359, then add the remaining 5: 359 + 5 = 364. Now, add the last score, which is 91. So 364 + 91. Let me add 364 + 90 first, which is 454, then add 1: 455. So the total sum is 455.\n\nNow, Jeff has five scores, so there are five numbers. To find the mean, I need to divide this total by 5. So, 455 divided by 5. Let me check that. 5 times 90 is 450. 455 - 450 is 5. 5 divided by 5 is 1. So total is 91. So 455 divided by 5 is 91. Therefore, the arithmetic mean is 91.\n\nLet me double-check my arithmetic to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's add the numbers again step by step:\n\n89 + 92 = 181 (correct)\n181 + 88 = 269 (correct)\n269 + 95 = 364 (correct)\n364 + 91 = 455 (correct)\n455 divided by 5 is 91 (correct)\n\nYes, that seems right. Another way to check: maybe add them in a different order or use a calculator-like method. But since my initial addition confirmed the answer, I can be confident now.\n\nAlternatively, maybe break down the numbers into tens and units to add: 80+90+80+90+90=380, and 9+2+8+5+1=25. Then 380 +25=405. Wait, that can't be right because 455 is different. So this method must be wrong. Where did I go wrong here?\n\nAh, I see. Because when I break them down as tens and units, I considered each number's place value individually and summed them separately, but arithmetic isn't additive that way. So that approach is incorrect because you can't just separate addition like decimal points. So the mistake was in thinking that 89 +92 +88 +95 +91 can be broken down into tens and units. In reality, each should be added as individual numbers. So maybe my previous method is more reliable.\n\nSo keeping that in mind, the correct sum is indeed 455, divided by 5 is 91. Therefore, the arithmetic mean is 91.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe arithmetic mean of Jeff's scores is \\boxed{91}.\n</think>\n\nJeff's five assignment scores are 89, 92, 88, 95, and 91.

What is the arithmetic mean of these five scores?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the average, which is called the arithmetic mean, from Jeff's five assignment scores. The scores are 89, 92, 88, 95, and 91. Hmm, arithmetic mean usually means adding all the numbers together and then dividing by how many numbers there are. So there are five numbers here. Let me try to add them up step by step to make sure I don't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the first two scores: 89 and 92. Let me add those first. 89 plus 92. Let me compute that. 80 plus 90 is 170, and then plus the remaining 9 and 2. Wait, no, actually, 89 plus 92. Let's do 89 + 90 is 179, and then add the extra 2, which gives me 181. Okay, so the first two scores add up to 181.\n\nNext, add the third score, which is 88. So 181 plus 88. Let's break that down. 181 + 80 is 261, and then add the remaining 8. That gives 269. So now the first three scores total 269.\n\nThen, adding the fourth score, 95. Let's take the current total of 269 and add 95. That's straightforward. 269 + 90 is 359, and then add 5 more to get 364. So the first four scores add up to 364.\n\nFinally, add the fifth score, which is 91. So take 364 and add 91. Hmm. Let's break that down. 364 + 90 is 454, and then add the remaining 1 to get 455. So all five scores add up to 455.\n\nNow, to find the arithmetic mean, I need to divide this total by the number of scores, which is 5. So 455 divided by 5. Let me calculate that. 5 times 90 is 450, so 455 minus 450 is 5. Therefore, 455 divided by 5 is 91 with a remainder of 5 divided by 5, which is 1. So that adds up to 91. So the arithmetic mean is 91.\n\nWait, let me verify by doing a simpler check. If I add all the numbers again, maybe I can find an alternative way. Let me re-add:\n\nFirst scores: 89 + 92 = 181\n\n88 + 181 = 269\n\n95 + 269 = 364\n\n91 + 364 = 455. Yep, same result. Then 455 divided by 5 is indeed 91. Okay, seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for arithmetic mean, which is sum of numbers divided by count. So 455 / 5 is straightforward, as I did. Another way, if I were to average step by step, I could do this:\n\nStart with the first number: 89.\n\nAverage after first: 89.\n\nAdding 92: 89 + 92 = 181; average is 181 / 2 = 90.5.\n\nAdding 88: 90.5 + 88 = 178.5; average is 178.5 / 3 \u2248 59.5.\n\nAdding 95: 59.5 + 95 = 154.5; average 154.5 / 4 \u2248 38.625.\n\nAdding 91: 38.625 + 91 = 129.625; average 129.625 / 5 = 25.925.\n\nWait, that gives me 25.925. Hmm, that can't be right. So where did I go wrong here?\n\nWait, this approach is incorrect. Because each average step should be recalculated based on the new total divided by the number of terms added. Let me check this method again.\n\nFirst average (1 term): 89.\n\nThen add 92: new total is 89 + 92 = 181. Number of terms is 2.\n\nNew average: 181 / 2 = 90.5.

I need to find the arithmetic mean of these scores. Hmm, arithmetic mean is just the average, right? So I remember that to find the average, I have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many numbers there are. Let me check if I got that right. Yeah, arithmetic mean specifically refers to the average. \n\nAlright, first step is to add all the scores together. Let me write them down again: 89, 92, 88, 95, and 91. Let me add them one by one. Starting with 89 and 92. 89 plus 92. Well, 89 plus 90 is 179, so 179 plus 2 is 181. So that part is 181. Then adding 88. 181 plus 88. Let me compute that. 181 + 80 is 261, then 261 + 8 is 269. Alright, so that's two scores added. Next score is 95. So 269 + 95. Breaking that down: 269 + 90 is 359, then +5 is 364. So now the total is 364. Let me check that again. \n\nWait, maybe I should add them in a different order to verify. Let's try adding 89 and 91 first. 89 + 91 is 180. Then 180 + 88. 180 + 80 is 260, +8 is 268. Hmm, different result. Wait, so which one is correct? There must be a mistake here. Let me see. Which is the right order to add them?\n\nOriginally, I added 89 + 92 first. Let me recalculate that. 89 + 92: 80 + 90 = 170, 9 + 2 = 11. So 170 + 11 = 181. Then 181 + 88: 180 + 80 = 260, 1 + 8 = 9. So 260 + 9 = 269. Then 269 + 95. Let's do 269 + 90 = 359, then +5 = 364. So first method: 89 + 92 + 88 + 95 + 91 = 364. Second method: 89 + 91 + 88 + 95 + 92 = 364. Wait, both methods give the same total? That can't be. So maybe I made a mistake in one of the additions. Wait, let me check 89 + 92: 89 + 90 = 179, plus 2 is 181. Then 181 + 88: let's do 181 + 90 = 271, subtract 2 to get 269. Then 269 + 95: 269 + 90 = 359, then +5 = 364. That seems correct. \n\nBut in the second method, 89 + 91 = 180, then 180 + 88 = 268, then 268 + 95 = 363, then +92 = 455? Wait, no. Wait, second method was adding to 88 first. Let me redo it:\n\n89 + 91 = 180\n\n88 + 95 = 183\n\nSo now 180 + 183 = 363. Then add 92? 363 + 92 = 455. Hmm, that's a different result. Wait, that's a problem. So why is there a discrepancy in the totals?\n\nWait, probably a miscalculation in one of the additions. Let me check again.\n\nFirst method:\n\n89 + 92: 181\n\n181 + 88: 269\n\n269 + 95: 364\n\nSecond method:\n\n89 + 91: 180\n\n180 + 88: 268\n\n", 0.5299999713897705], ["25", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Hmm, 90 + 90 is 180, but 89 + 92 should be a bit less. Let's do 89 + 92. 92 is 2 more than 90, so 89 + 2 is 91, so 91 + 90 is 181. Wait, 89 + 92 equals 181? Let me verify by adding 90 + 90 = 180, so 89 + 92 is 180 + 2 = 182. Wait, so I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again. 89 + 92. 89 + 90 is 179, plus 2 is 181. Yes, that's correct. So 89 + 92 = 181.\n\nNext, add 181 to 88. Let's do 181 + 88. 88 + 81 is 169, so 181 + 88 is 169 + 10 + 1 = 180? Wait, 88 + 81 is 169, then 169 + 10 is 179, plus 1 is 180. So 181 + 88 = 180.\n\nThen add 180 to 95. 180 + 95. 180 + 90 is 270, plus 5 is 275. So 180 + 95 = 275.\n\nNow, add 275 to 91. 275 + 91. Let's break that down. 275 + 90 is 365, then +1 is 366.

So, Jeff has five assignment scores: 89, 92, 88, 95, and 91. The question is asking for the arithmetic mean of these scores. Hmm, arithmetic mean... right, that's basically the average. To find the average, I remember it's calculated by adding all the numbers together and then dividing by how many numbers there are. Let me make sure I remember the formula correctly. \n\nSo, formula-wise, arithmetic mean (average) = (sum of all values) / (number of values). Got it. Let me write that down. \n\nGiven values: 89, 92, 88, 95, 91. Number of values, n = 5 here. I need to add all those numbers first. Let me add them one by one step by step. \n\nStarting with 89 and 92: 89 + 92. Let me compute that. 80 + 90 is 170, 9 + 2 is 11, so 170 + 11 is 181. Okay, so 89 + 92 is 181. \n\nNext, add that result to the next number, which is 88. So 181 + 88. Let's do 181 + 80 = 261, then +8 more is 269. Alright, so 181 + 88 is 269. \n\nNow, add that to the next number, which is 95. Let's take 269 + 95. Breaking it down: 260 + 90 = 350, 9 + 5 = 14, so 350 + 14 = 364. So, 269 + 95 is 364. \n\nFinally, add the last number, 91, to that. So 364 + 91. Let's compute that. 360 + 90 = 450, 4 + 1 = 5, so 450 + 5 = 455. Therefore, the total sum of all five scores is 455. \n\nNow, to find the arithmetic mean, I need to divide this total sum by the number of values, which is 5. So, 455 divided by 5. Let me do that division. \n\n455 \u00f7 5. Hmm, 5 goes into 4 zero times, so we write 0. Then 5 goes into 45 nine times (9*5=45). Subtract 45 from 45, remainder zero. Bring down the next 5. 5 goes into 5 once. So, 91. So, 455 divided by 5 is 91. \n\nWait, let me verify that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the division. 5 times 91 is indeed 455. Because 5*90=450 and 5*1=5, so 450+5=455. Yep, that checks out. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the arithmetic mean is 91. Let me confirm by adding all the numbers one more time just to be thorough. \n\nOriginal scores: 89, 92, 88, 95, 91. Let me add them again. \n\n89 + 92 = 181. Correct. 181 + 88 = 269. Correct. 269 + 95 = 364. Correct. 364 + 91 = 455. Yep, same result. \n\nTherefore, dividing 455 by 5 gives 91. \n\nSo, the arithmetic mean of Jeff's five assignment scores is 91. I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap all steps to make sure I didn't skip anything. \n\n1. Sum all five numbers: 89 + 92 + 88 + 95 + 91 = 455. \n2. Divide the sum by the number of values (5): 455 \u00f7 5 = 91. \n\nEverything seems to check out. No mistakes in division, addition, or multiplication.

What is the arithmetic mean of these five scores?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the arithmetic mean of Jeff's five assignment scores. The scores given are 89, 92, 88, 95, and 91. Hmm, arithmetic mean. I remember that the arithmetic mean is the sum of all numbers divided by how many numbers there are. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should add up all the scores. Let me write them down: 89, 92, 88, 95, 91. Let me add them sequentially. Starting with 89 and 92. If I add those together, 89 + 92. Let me do that: 80 + 90 equals 170, and 9 + 2 equals 11, so 170 + 11 is 181. Okay, so 89 + 92 is 181. Then the next score is 88. So 181 + 88. Let me add those. 180 + 80 is 260, and 1 + 8 is 9, so 260 + 9 is 269. Got that. Next is 95. So 269 + 95. Let's split them up: 260 + 90 is 350, and 9 + 5 is 14, so 350 + 14 is 364. Then the last one is 91. Adding that to 364: 360 + 90 is 450, and 4 + 1 is 5, so 450 + 5 is 455. Wait, that feels like a lot. Let me check my calculations again step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting over: 89 + 92. Let's add vertically:\n\n     89\n   +92\n   ----\n   181\n\nYes, that's correct. Then 181 + 88:\n\n  181\n+ 88\n-----\n 269\n\nHmm, 181 + 80 is 261, plus 8 is 269. Okay. Then 269 + 95:\n\n  269\n+ 95\n-----\n 364\n\n269 + 90 is 359, plus 5 is 364. Then 364 + 91:\n\n364 + 90 is 454, plus 1 is 455. That seems right.\n\nSo the total sum is 455. Now, the arithmetic mean is the sum divided by the number of scores. Jeff has five scores. So 455 divided by 5. Let me compute that.\n\n455 \u00f7 5. 5 goes into 45 five times (5*9=45), subtract 45 from 45, remainder 0. Bring down the 5. 5 goes into 5 once. So 91. So the mean is 91. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me verify once more to be sure.\n\nAlternative method: Maybe convert all the scores to numbers, add them up, and divide by the number of items. Wait, I did that before. Let me check once again.\n\n89 + 92 + 88 + 95 + 91. Let me pair them up to make it easier. 89 + 91 = 180. 92 + 95 = 187. Then 180 + 187 = 367. Then 88 left. 367 + 88 = 455. Yep, same result.\n\nSo 455 divided by 5. Let's do this division differently. 5 into 45 is 9, 45 - 45 = 0. Bring down the 5. 5 into 5 is 1. So 91. Exactly. So the arithmetic mean is 91. That's the answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure there's no trick here. The problem says \"Jeff's five assignment scores\" and wants the arithmetic mean. No, straightforward. So yes, I think 91 is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe arithmetic mean of Jeff's five scores is \\boxed{91}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the arithmetic mean of Jeff's five assignment scores \\(89, 92, 88, 95,\\) and \\(91", 1.5299999713897705], ["25", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Express your answer in interval notation.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for the values of b where -2 is not in the range of the function f(x) = x\u00b2 + bx + 2. So, essentially, we need to find all real numbers b such that the equation x\u00b2 + bx + 2 = -2 has no real solutions. Because if there are no real solutions, that means -2 never gets reached by the function, so -2 is not in its range.\n\nAlright, step by step. First, let me write down the equation that we need to check for no real solutions. From the problem, setting f(x) = -2 gives:\n\nx\u00b2 + bx + 2 = -2\n\nSubtracting -2 from both sides to bring everything to one side:\n\nx\u00b2 + bx + 4 = 0\n\nSo, now we have the quadratic equation x\u00b2 + bx + 4 = 0. For this equation to have no real solutions, the discriminant must be negative. The discriminant of a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0 is given by D = b\u00b2 - 4ac. If D < 0, there are no real roots.\n\nIn our case, the coefficients are a = 1, b = b (but wait, wait, changing notation. Let me make sure. The equation is x\u00b2 + bx + 4 = 0. So, the coefficients are a = 1, b (the linear term) is still b here. Wait, no, the quadratic is ax\u00b2 + bx + c, so here, the linear coefficient is b, so the discriminant is D = b\u00b2 - 4*1*4 = b\u00b2 - 16.\n\nSo, to have no real solutions, we need D < 0:\n\nb\u00b2 - 16 < 0\n\nSolving that inequality:\n\nb\u00b2 < 16\n\nTaking square roots, we get:\n\n-4 < b < 4\n\nTherefore, the values of b for which -2 is not in the range of f(x) are all real numbers between -4 and 4, not including -4 and 4 themselves.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check this. Let's verify with an example. If b is 3, then the equation becomes x\u00b2 + 3x + 4 = 0. The discriminant would be 9 - 16 = -7, which is negative, so no real roots. Therefore, -2 is not in the range. If b is 5, discriminant is 25 - 16 = 9, which is positive, so real roots. Therefore, -2 is in the range. Similarly, take b = -5. Then discriminant is 25 - 16 = 9 again, positive. So, -2 is in the range. If b is 3, as before, no roots. So yes, the interval is (-4, 4).\n\nTherefore, the answer should be (-4, 4).\n\nBut let me think again. The original problem says \"values of b for which -2 is not in the range of f(x)\". So, another way to look at this is, to find all b such that the minimum value of f(x) is greater than -2. Because if the minimum value is greater than -2, then -2 is below the minimum, so -2 is not in the range.\n\nSo, to confirm, let's find the minimum value of f(x) = x\u00b2 + bx + 2. Since it's a quadratic opening upwards (coefficient of x\u00b2 is 1, which is positive), the minimum occurs at x = -b/(2a) = -b/(2*1) = -b/2. Then the minimum value is f(-b/2). Let's compute that.\n\nCompute f(-b/2):\n\nf(-b/2) = (-b/2)^2 + b*(-b/2) + 2\n\n= b\u00b2/4 - b\u00b2/2 + 2\n\n= -b\u00b2/4 + 2\n\nSo the minimum value is 2 - b\u00b2/4.\n\nFor -2 not to be in the range, we need the minimum value greater than -2:\n\n2 - (b\u00b2)/4 > -2\n\nSolving this inequality:\n\n2 + 2 > (b\u00b2)/4\n\n4 > (b\u00b2)/4\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\n16 > b\u00b2\n\nSo, b\u00b2 < 16, which again gives -4 < b < 4.\n\nYep, that's consistent with the previous result. So that's another way to approach it: find where the minimum of the function is greater than -2. So both methods lead to the same interval.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (-4, 4).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe values of \\( b \\)", 0.47999998927116394], ["25", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Hmm, let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the range of a quadratic function tells us the possible output values. Since this function is a quadratic, its graph is a parabola. Depending on the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\), it opens upwards or downwards. In this case, the coefficient is 1, which is positive, so the parabola opens upwards. That means the minimum value of the function is at its vertex, and the function goes to infinity as \\( x \\) approaches positive or negative infinity.\n\nThe question is asking for values of \\( b \\) where \\( -2 \\) is not in the range. So, \\( -2 \\) must be either less than the minimum value of the function or not attainable at all. But since the parabola opens upwards, even if it doesn't reach \\( -2 \\), it will go below any finite \\( y \\)-value. Wait, no. If the parabola doesn't go below a certain point, but since it opens upwards, it will go to infinity. So actually, any value below the minimum is not in the range. Then, the range starts at the minimum and goes to infinity. Therefore, \\( -2 \\) is not in the range if and only if \\( -2 \\) is less than the minimum value of the function.\n\nSo, my task reduces to finding the minimum value of \\( f(x) \\) in terms of \\( b \\), and then solving the inequality where that minimum is greater than \\( -2 \\). Let me verify that logic.\n\nFirst, let's find the vertex of the quadratic function \\( f(x) = x^2 + bx + 2 \\). The vertex occurs at \\( x = -\\frac{b}{2} \\). Plugging that back into \\( f(x) \\), we get the minimum value:\n\n\\( f\\left(-\\frac{b}{2}\\right) = \\left(-\\frac{b}{2}\\right)^2 + b\\left(-\\frac{b}{2}\\right) + 2 \\)\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\( \\frac{b^2}{4} - \\frac{b^2}{2} + 2 = \\frac{b^2}{4} - \\frac{2b^2}{4} + \\frac{8}{4} = -\\frac{b^2}{4} + 2 \\)\n\nSo the minimum value of \\( f(x) \\) is \\( -\\frac{b^2}{4} + 2 \\).\n\nNow, for \\( -2 \\) not to be in the range, this minimum must be greater than \\( -2 \\). Therefore, we set up the inequality:\n\n\\( -\\frac{b^2}{4} + 2 > -2 \\)\n\nSolving this inequality:\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n\n\\( -\\frac{b^2}{4} > -4 \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 (since 4 is positive, the inequality sign doesn't change):\n\n\\( -b^2 > -16 \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 (which reverses the inequality):\n\n\\( b^2 < 16 \\)\n\nTaking square roots:\n\n\\( |b| < 4 \\)\n\nWhich implies:\n\n\\( -4 < b < 4 \\)\n\nTherefore, the values of \\( b \\) for which \\( -2 \\) is not in the range are all real numbers between -4 and 4, not including the endpoints.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So starting from the minimum value of the function: \\( -\\frac{b^2}{4} + 2 \\). Setting that greater than -2 leads to \\( -b^2/4 + 2 > -2 \\). Subtract 2: \\( -b^2/4 > -4 \\). Multiply by 4: \\( -b^2 > -16 \\). Multiply by -1: \\( b^2 < 16 \\). So yes, that seems correct. Hence, the solution is \\( -4 < b < 4 \\).\n\nBut let me check with some test values to confirm. Let's take \\( b = 0 \\).\n\nThen \\( f(x) = x^2 + 0 + 2 = x^2 + 2 \\). The minimum is at \\( x = 0 \\), which gives \\( f(0) = 2 \\). So the range is \\( [2, \\infty) \\).

The problem is asking for the values of b where -2 is not in the range of the function f(x) = x\u00b2 + bx + 2. Hmm, so I need to find all b such that when you plug in x for the function f, you never get -2. In other words, the equation x\u00b2 + bx + 2 = -2 should have no real solutions. Yeah, that makes sense. \n\nSo, if I set f(x) = -2, then I get the equation x\u00b2 + bx + 2 = -2. Let me write that down: x\u00b2 + bx + 2 + 2 = 0. Wait, no, actually, subtracting -2 from both sides would make it x\u00b2 + bx + 2 = -2, so bringing the -2 to the left side, it becomes x\u00b2 + bx + 4 = 0. Wait, let me check that again. \n\nOriginal equation: x\u00b2 + bx + 2 = -2. Subtracting -2 from both sides is the same as adding 2. So, x\u00b2 + bx + 2 + 2 = 0. That's x\u00b2 + bx + 4 = 0. So, the equation simplifies to x\u00b2 + bx + 4 = 0. For -2 not to be in the range of f, this equation should have no real roots. \n\nTo have no real roots, the discriminant must be negative. The discriminant of a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0 is D = b\u00b2 - 4ac. In this case, a = 1, b is the same as before, but wait, earlier I had the equation x\u00b2 + bx + 4 = 0. Wait, but let me confirm. Let me redo the steps vertically to avoid confusion.\n\nOriginal equation after moving everything to the left: x\u00b2 + bx + 2 = -2. Then, adding 2 to both sides gives x\u00b2 + bx + 4 = 0. Yes, that's correct. So, the quadratic is x\u00b2 + bx + 4 = 0. \n\nFor this quadratic to have no real roots, the discriminant D must be less than 0. So, D = b\u00b2 - 4*1*4 < 0. That simplifies to b\u00b2 - 16 < 0. So, solving b\u00b2 < 16. Taking square roots, |b| < 4. That means -4 < b < 4. \n\nTherefore, the values of b for which -2 is not in the range of f(x) are those between -4 and 4. So, in interval notation, that's (-4, 4). \n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst, setting f(x) = -2 gives x\u00b2 + bx + 2 = -2, so adding 2: x\u00b2 + bx + 4 = 0. Then discriminant D = b\u00b2 - 16. So, D < 0 => b\u00b2 < 16 => |b| < 4. So, yes, the solution is -4 < b < 4, which in interval notation is (-4, 4). \n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. Let me check with an example. If b = 0, then the equation is x\u00b2 + 4 = 0. The discriminant is 0\u00b2 - 16 = -16 < 0, so no real roots. If b = 4, then the discriminant is 16 - 16 = 0, which would mean one real root. But b has to be less than 4, so maybe approaching 4 from below. If b approaches 4, then D approaches 0 from below, so the equation would have one real root approaching 4 from below. So, that is correct. Similarly, if b is -4, then D becomes (-4)^2 -16 = 16 -16 = 0, so x\u00b2 -4x +4 = 0. Which factors as (x - 2)^2 = 0, so double root at x = 2. So, x=2 is a root, but since it's a double root, the graph touches the x-axis there but doesn't cross. So, that's still okay. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that b must lie in (-4, 4). \n\nI think that's all right. Let me check once more. The original function is a parabola opening upwards (since the coefficient of x\u00b2 is positive). The vertex of this parabola could be at the minimum point.

Hmm, let me start by recalling that the range of a quadratic function is either a closed interval or a ray, depending on whether the parabola opens upwards or downwards, and whether it has a minimum or maximum point.\n\nThe function here is \\( f(x) = x^2 + bx + 2 \\). Since the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is 1, which is positive, this parabola opens upwards. That means the function has a minimum value, and the range will be all real numbers greater than or equal to this minimum. But the question is asking for the values of \\( b \\) where \\( -2 \\) is not in the range. In other words, we need to find the values of \\( b \\) for which the equation \\( x^2 + bx + 2 = -2 \\) has no real solutions. Because if there are no real solutions, then \\( -2 \\) isn't in the range.\n\nSo let me set up the equation:\n\n\\( x^2 + bx + 2 = -2 \\)\n\nSubtracting -2 from both sides?\n\nWait, maybe step by step. Let's rearrange the equation:\n\n\\( x^2 + bx + 2 + 2 = 0 \\)\n\nWait, that would be \\( x^2 + bx + 4 = 0 \\). Wait, let me check: original equation is \\( x^2 + bx + 2 = -2 \\). So subtract 2 from both sides:\n\n\\( x^2 + bx + 2 - (-2) = 0 \\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\( x^2 + bx + 4 = 0 \\)\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should subtract 2 from both sides first? Let's see:\n\nOriginal equation: \\( x^2 + b x + 2 = -2 \\)\n\nSubtract -2 from both sides is the same as adding 2, so:\n\n\\( x^2 + b x + 2 + 2 = x^2 + b x + 4 = 0 \\)\n\nYes, that's right. So the equation simplifies to \\( x^2 + b x + 4 = 0 \\).\n\nNow, for this quadratic equation to have no real solutions, the discriminant must be negative. The discriminant \\( D \\) of a quadratic \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) is \\( b^2 - 4ac \\). In our case, the quadratic is \\( x^2 + b x + 4 \\), so \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = b \\) (since the middle coefficient is \\( b \\)), and \\( c = 4 \\).\n\nTherefore, the discriminant is:\n\n\\( D = b^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 4 = b^2 - 16 \\)\n\nFor the quadratic equation to have no real roots, we need \\( D < 0 \\):\n\n\\( b^2 - 16 < 0 \\)\n\nSolving this inequality:\n\n\\( b^2 < 16 \\)\n\nTaking square roots:\n\n\\( |b| < 4 \\)\n\nWhich means:\n\n\\( -4 < b < 4 \\)\n\nTherefore, the values of \\( b \\) for which \\( -2 \\) is not in the range of \\( f(x) \\) are those between -4 and 4, not including the endpoints.\n\nBut let me double-check this. Let's verify by substituting the discriminant condition.\n\nIf \\( b^2 - 16 < 0 \\), then the quadratic in x has no real roots. Hence, the equation \\( x^2 + b x + 4 = 0 \\) is never satisfied for any real x, which implies that \\( -2 \\) is not in the range of \\( f(x) \\).\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the minimum value of the function \\( f(x) = x^2 + b x + 2 \\).

Hmm, the range of a function is all the possible output values it can take. If I want -2 not to be in the range, that means there are no real numbers \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = -2 \\). So essentially, the equation \\( x^2 + bx + 2 = -2 \\) should have no real solutions. Let me check that step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the equation:\n\n\\( x^2 + bx + 2 = -2 \\)\n\nSubtracting -2 from both sides to bring everything to one side:\n\n\\( x^2 + bx + 2 + 2 = 0 \\)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\( x^2 + bx + 4 = 0 \\)\n\nSo now I have a quadratic equation \\( x^2 + bx + 4 = 0 \\).

Therefore, in that case, -2 is not in the range of \\( f(x) \\).\n\nWait, let me verify this with an example. Suppose \\( b = 0 \\), then the equation becomes \\( x^2 + 0x + 4 = 0 \\), which is \\( x^2 + 4 = 0 \\). That has no real roots since the solutions are imaginary. So indeed, \\( -2 \\) is not in the range. If I try \\( b = 4 \\), the equation becomes \\( x^2 + 4x + 4 = 0 \\), which factors as \\( (x + 2)^2 = 0 \\), so \\( x = -2 \\) is a double root. Similarly, if \\( b = -4 \\), the equation becomes \\( x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0 \\), which is \\( (x - 2)^2 = 0 \\), so again a double root. So these boundary values also result in a repeated root, but even so, -2 is not in the range because the function never actually reaches -2. But when \\( b \\) is between -4 and 4, the quadratic does not cross the line \\( y = -2 \\), so -2 is indeed not in the range.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be all real numbers \\( b \\) such that \\( -4 \\leq b \\leq 4 \\).

Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is asking for the volume of a cylinder formed by rotating a square with side length 14 cm around its vertical line of symmetry. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you rotate a shape around an axis, the resulting volume can be found using the method of integration or using the formula for the volume generated by rotating a region. In this case, the shape we're rotating is a square, and the axis of rotation is its vertical line of symmetry. So, I need to figure out what exactly is being rotated here.\n\nA square has four sides of equal length, each 14 cm. The vertical line of symmetry would be passing through the center of the square, right? So, if the square is oriented with its sides horizontal and vertical, the vertical line of symmetry is the vertical line that cuts the square exactly in half. That means when we rotate the square around this vertical line, we're essentially creating a cylinder, right?\n\nWait, but how exactly does rotating the square form a cylinder? Let me visualize this. Imagine a square standing upright. If we spin it around its vertical centerline, the top and bottom edges of the square will trace out circles. Similarly, the left and right edges will also trace circles. But since the axis is vertical, the radius of the cylinder should be half the side length of the square? Wait, the side length is 14 cm, so half of that is 7 cm. That makes sense because the radius of the cylinder should be the distance from the axis of rotation (the vertical centerline) to the edge of the square, which is half the side length.\n\nThen, the height of the cylinder would be equal to the side length of the square, which is 14 cm. So, the cylinder has a radius of 7 cm and a height of 14 cm. Then, the volume would be \u03c0r\u00b2h. Plugging in the numbers, that would be \u03c0(7\u00b2)(14). Let me compute that.\n\n7 squared is 49, so 49 times 14. Hmm, 49 times 10 is 490, and 49 times 4 is 196, so total is 490 + 196 = 686. Therefore, the volume would be 686\u03c0 cm\u00b3. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here.\n\nWait, another way to think about this: when we rotate a square around its vertical line of symmetry, the path traced by each corner point is a circle. So, actually, the cylinder's volume can also be found by considering the lateral surface area of the cylinder. That is, the area of the rectangle that forms the lateral surface when the rectangle is wrapped around the cylinder. The height of this rectangle is the height of the cylinder, which is 14 cm (the side length of the square). The width of the rectangle is the circumference of the base of the cylinder, which is 2\u03c0r. So, the surface area of the cylinder (excluding the top and bottom) is 2\u03c0r * h. Setting that equal to the lateral surface area, which should be equal to the area swept by the rotating square.\n\nBut since the square's sides are being rotated, this method might not be directly applicable. Alternatively, maybe breaking down the square step by step. Let me try another approach.\n\nWhen you rotate the square around its vertical line of symmetry, each point on the square takes a circular path. The corners of the square will trace circles with radius 7 cm (half the side length). The top and bottom edges, which are 14 cm long, when rotated will trace out cylinders themselves. But actually, each edge of the square, when rotated 360 degrees around the vertical axis, forms a cylinder. However, the top and bottom edges, which are straight lines, when rotated, form circular arcs as well. But in the case of a square, the top and bottom edges are perpendicular to the axis of rotation, so their rotation would form circles, not arcs. Wait, but actually, when you rotate a straight line segment around an axis perpendicular to the segment, it forms a cylinder. But here, the axis is vertical, and the square has horizontal and vertical sides. Rotating the horizontal sides (which are parallel to the axis) would trace circles, and rotating the vertical sides (perpendicular to the axis) would trace straight lines? Hmm, maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, let's think again. The vertical line of symmetry is the vertical centerline of the square. So, if we rotate the square around this axis, each horizontal edge (which is horizontal and perpendicular to the axis) will trace a circle with radius equal to half the side length, right? Because the endpoints of each horizontal edge are h/2 away from the axis.

So the problem is asking for the volume of a cylinder formed by rotating a square with side length 14 cm around its vertical line of symmetry. Hmm, okay. Let me visualize this. A square is a shape with four equal sides. If we rotate it around one of its vertical lines of symmetry, what does that look like?\n\nFirst, let's recall that the volume of a cylinder is given by the formula \\( V = \\pi r^2 h \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius and \\( h \\) is the height. So, I need to find the radius and height of the cylinder created by rotating the square.\n\nThe square has side length 14 cm. When we rotate it around its vertical line of symmetry, I think this is an axis passing through the center of the square. Since it's a square, the line of symmetry is vertical and goes through the center from top to bottom. Wait, actually, depending on which side we're rotating around, the cylinder's dimensions might change. Let me confirm.\n\nIf the square is rotated around its vertical line of symmetry, that will result in a cylinder with height equal to the side length of the square, and the radius equal to half of the side length. Is that correct?\n\nWait, let me think again. When you rotate a square around one of its lines of symmetry (which is a vertical axis through its center), the resulting shape is a cylinder. The height of the cylinder would be equal to the side length of the square, because that's the distance from one side of the square to the other along the axis of rotation. The radius of the cylinder would be half the side length, since the square extends from one side of the center to the other.\n\nSo, if the side length is 14 cm, then the radius \\( r \\) would be \\( 14 / 2 = 7 \\) cm, and the height \\( h \\) would be 14 cm. Therefore, the volume \\( V \\) would be \\( \\pi \\times 7^2 \\times 14 \\).\n\nLet me compute that step by step. First, \\( 7^2 = 49 \\). Then, 49 multiplied by 14. Let's do 49 times 10 plus 49 times 4, which is 490 + 196 = 686. So, the volume is \\( 686\\pi \\) cubic centimeters.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. The line of symmetry is vertical, and the square is rotated around that line. When you rotate a square around a vertical line through its center, the resulting cylinder has height equal to the square's side length (from left to right, top to bottom) and the radius equal to half the side length. Therefore, the volume formula should indeed multiply the radius squared by the height.\n\nSo, 14 cm side length, radius 7 cm, height 14 cm. Volume = \u03c0 * 7^2 * 14 = \u03c0 * 49 * 14. Let's compute 49 * 14. 49 * 10 = 490, 49 * 4 = 196. Adding those gives 490 + 196 = 686. So, yes, 686\u03c0 cubic centimeters.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Wait, maybe I should confirm that rotating a square around its vertical line of symmetry generates a cylinder. Let's imagine the square lying horizontally, with its vertical line of symmetry somewhere in the middle. When we rotate it 360 degrees around that vertical axis, each point on the square will trace out a circle. The farthest point from the axis is at the center, and the closest are at the edges. The distance from each point on the square to the axis would vary depending on their position relative to the axis. However, since the axis is vertical through the center, the maximum distance (radius) is half the side length, and the minimum distance is zero (if we rotate points that are on the axis). Therefore, the resulting solid is a cylinder with radius 7 cm and height 14 cm.\n\nAlternatively, if the axis of rotation is the vertical side, then the height of the cylinder would be 14 cm, and the radius would still be 7 cm. Yes, because regardless of which side is rotated, the maximum distance from the axis is half the side length, so the radius is always 7 cm. The height is the side length because when you rotate the entire square, the maximum extent along the axis is the full side length, and the minimum (though zero) would occur where the line of rotation (the side itself) is, but that part doesn't contribute", 0.5099999904632568], ["25", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the volume of a cylinder formed by rotating a square with a side length of 14 centimeters around its vertical line of symmetry. Hmm, okay, so first, I need to visualize what's happening here. When you rotate a square around one of its vertical lines of symmetry, which direction is that vertical line of symmetry? In a square, the vertical line of symmetry would be the line that divides the square into two equal halves, right? So, from the midpoint of one side to the midpoint of the opposite side. Got it.\n\nSo, the square is, let's say, 14 cm on each side. If I rotate it around its vertical line of symmetry, which I think is the central vertical axis of the square. So, if I imagine the square standing upright, its vertical line of symmetry is like the central vertical line going through the midpoints of the top and bottom sides. When we rotate the square around this line, what shape do we get?\n\nWait, when rotating a square around its vertical central axis, the result is indeed a cylinder. The height of the cylinder would be equal to the diameter of the square, and the radius would be half the side length. Let me verify that.\n\nThe side length is 14 cm, so the diameter of the cylinder's base would be 14 cm. Therefore, the radius \\( r \\) is \\( \\frac{14}{2} = 7 \\) cm. The height \\( h \\) of the cylinder, which is the distance traveled by any point on the square's edge (which is the length of the side) around the central axis. Since we're rotating around a vertical line, the height should be the same as the length of the side, right? So, height is 14 cm.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure. If we rotate the square 360 degrees around its vertical central axis, the top and bottom edges of the square will form the top and bottom circles of the cylinder, while the vertical sides will wrap around. So yes, the height of the cylinder is equal to the length of the square's side, which is 14 cm. So, the dimensions of the cylinder are:\n\n- Radius \\( r = 7 \\) cm\n- Height \\( h = 14 \\) cm\n\nThen, the volume of the cylinder is given by \\( \\pi r^2 h \\). Plugging in the values:\n\n\\( \\pi \\times 7^2 \\times 14 \\)\n\nLet me compute that step by step. First, 7 squared is 49. Then, 49 multiplied by 14. Let me do 49 times 10, which is 490, and 49 times 4, which is 196, adding them together gives 686. So, 49 times 14 is 686. Therefore, the volume is \\( 686 \\pi \\) cubic centimeters.\n\nWait, let me double-check if my reasoning is correct. The square's vertical axis of symmetry is the axis about which you're rotating. If you imagine holding the square so that it's rotating around its central vertical axis, the topmost and bottommost edges (which are 14 cm apart) will trace out circles with radius 7 cm. So, the height of the cylinder is 14 cm, which is the original side length. That makes sense. The lateral surface area of the cylinder would be the side length times the circumference of the base, which is 14 cm times 2\u03c0r, which is 14 * 2\u03c0*7 = 14*14\u03c0 = 196\u03c0. But the volume is different; it's the area of the base times height, so \u03c0r\u00b2h. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 686\u03c0 cubic centimeters. Let me check once more to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. 7*7 is 49, 49*14: 49*10=490, 49*4=196; 490+196=686. Yep, that's solid. So I'm confident the volume is 686\u03c0 cm\u00b3.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe volume is \\boxed{686\\pi} cubic centimeters.\n</think>\n\nTo find the volume of the cylinder formed by rotating a square with side length 14 cm around its vertical line of symmetry, we start by identifying the dimensions of the resulting cylinder. \n\nThe vertical line of symmetry of the square (which is a square with a side length of 14 cm) is the central vertical axis.

Hmm, let me think. First, let's visualize what's happening here. If I have a square and I rotate it around its central vertical line (since the line of symmetry is vertical), which is connecting two opposite sides. So, when I rotate the square around that central vertical axis, the height of the cylinder will be the same as the side length of the square. Wait, isn't that right? Let me confirm. The line of symmetry is from the top to the bottom of the square, so when we rotate the square around that axis, the height of the cylinder should be equal to the side length. The radius of the cylinder, on the other hand, would be half of the square's side length because that's the distance from the center of the square to the side. Since the side length is 14 cm, half of that is 7 cm. So the radius is 7 cm. \n\nNow, the volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = \u03c0r\u00b2h. Plugging in the values we have: r = 7 cm, h = 14 cm. So, V = \u03c0*(7)\u00b2*14. Let me compute that step by step. 7 squared is 49, and 49 multiplied by 14. Let me check 49*10=490, 49*4=196, so 490+196=686. Therefore, the volume is 686\u03c0 cubic centimeters. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. The axis of rotation is the vertical line of symmetry. So, if the square is lying on a horizontal plane, its vertical sides would be along the axis of rotation. So, when rotated, the height of the cylinder is the length of the side, which is 14 cm, and the radius is half of that, which is 7 cm. That seems correct. So, the volume should be \u03c0 times radius squared times height. So, 7\u00b2 is 49, times 14 is 686. Yep, that seems right. \n\nAnother way to think about it is by considering the volume swept by the square. Since the square is rotating around its vertical line of symmetry, each point on the square traces a circle perpendicular to the axis of rotation. The radius of each circle is the horizontal distance from the axis to the point. For points on the top and bottom sides of the square, the horizontal distance is zero (since the axis is vertical), so their circles have radius zero. For points on the left and right sides, the horizontal distance is half the side length, which is 7 cm. Therefore, each of those sides, when rotated, creates a cylinder edge. The volume of the cylinder is the integral of the areas of these circles from the bottom to the top. But since all points on the left and right sides contribute to a radius of 7 cm, the volume is simply \u03c0r\u00b2h, which is the same as if we treated a rectangle with width 14 (the circumference) and height 14. Wait, hold on, maybe I need to verify this method as well. \n\nIf we model the square as a rectangle and rotate it around its vertical symmetry, each horizontal slice is a circle with radius equal to the horizontal distance from the axis. The horizontal distance for the left and right sides is 7 cm, so the radius is 7 cm. The vertical extent of the rectangle is 14 cm. So, integrating over the height, the volume of rotation of a rectangle around one of its axes. Wait, actually, rotating a rectangle around one of its sides of length 14 cm. The volume would be the area of the rectangle times the circumference of the circle with radius 7 cm. So, area is 14*14 = 196. Circumference is 2\u03c0*7 = 14\u03c0. Multiply them: 196 * 14\u03c0. Let's compute 196*14 first. 200*14=2800, subtract 4*14=56, so 2800-56=2744. Therefore, the volume is 2744\u03c0 cubic centimeters. But earlier, using the cylinder formula, I got 686\u03c0. These two results differ. That can't be right. So, there must be a mistake here. So, which is the correct approach? \n\nWait, if I take the rectangle (the square) and rotate it around one of its sides, the resulting solid is a cylinder.

The question is asking for the volume of a cylinder formed by rotating a square with side length 14 cm about its vertical line of symmetry. The answer needs to be in cubic centimeters and expressed in terms of \u03c0. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the square and how rotating it about its vertical axis of symmetry creates a cylinder. A square has four sides of equal length, right? So each side is 14 cm. The vertical line of symmetry here probably refers to the line that divides the square vertically into two equal parts. That would be the central vertical line of the square. So, when we rotate the square around this vertical axis, each point on the square traces out a circular path with radius equal to the horizontal distance from that point to the center of the square.\n\nWait, let me confirm. If the square is rotated around its vertical line of symmetry, which is the vertical midline, then the radius of rotation for each point should be half the side length of the square. Because the distance from any point on the square to the central vertical line is half the side length. For example, the left edge is 14 cm from the center, so the radius would be 14 cm. But actually, 14 cm is the full side length, so half of that is 7 cm. Wait, no. Let me check that again.\n\nThe vertical line of symmetry is passing through the center of the square. Each side of the square is 14 cm. So, if we take a point on the top edge, it's 7 cm away from the vertical center, same for the bottom edge. For the vertical edges, the point is at the center (0,0) in some coordinate system, so they don't contribute to the radius unless we're considering rotation around an axis. Wait, hold on. Let's model this.\n\nImagine the square is centered at the origin for simplicity. Each side is 14 cm, so half the side length is 7 cm. The vertical axis of symmetry is the y-axis here. When we rotate the square about the y-axis, each point on the square will trace out a circle perpendicular to the y-axis. The radius of each circle will be the distance from the point to the y-axis. The top and bottom edges are located at y = \u00b17 cm, so their radius is 7 cm. The left and right edges are at x = \u00b17 cm, so their radius is also 7 cm. The vertical edges are at x and y from -7 to 7, so rotating them around the y-axis would result in circles with radius 7 cm as well.\n\nWait, but if we rotate the entire square, each point on the square will indeed trace out a circle of radius equal to the horizontal distance from that point to the y-axis. Since all points are either at x = \u00b17 cm or y = \u00b17 cm, rotating them around the y-axis gives circles of radius 7 cm. Therefore, the cylinder formed has a radius of 7 cm and a height of 14 cm (the side length of the square).\n\nBut let me double-check. If the square is rotated about its vertical midline, which is the line x = 0. The square spans from x = -7 to x = 7 and y = -7 to y = 7. Rotating around the y-axis (x=0) would make the radius of each cross-sectional circle equal to the x-coordinate of the point. So, for example, the point (7,7) in the top right corner would have a radius of 7 cm. Similarly, rotating the point (7,-7) would have a radius of 7 cm as well. So yes, the radius of the cylinder is 7 cm. The height of the cylinder is the side length of the square, which is 14 cm. Therefore, the volume should be \u03c0r\u00b2h = \u03c0(7\u00b2)(14).\n\nCalculating that: 7 squared is 49, multiplied by 14 is 686. So the volume is 686\u03c0 cm\u00b3. Let me make sure there's no mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is the lateral surface area when rotating the square. But wait, rotating a square about its vertical axis of symmetry would actually create a cylinder. The volume is indeed the area of the base (circle) multiplied by the height. Since the radius is 7 cm, area is \u03c0*7\u00b2, and height is 14 cm. Multiply them together, 7*7 is 49, 49*14=686. So yes, volume is 686\u03c0 cm\u00b3.\n\nI don't see any errors in my reasoning.

Hmm, let me try to visualize this first. A square has four sides, each of length 14 cm. If we rotate it about its vertical line of symmetry, which I assume is a vertical line going through the center of the square, right? So rotating the square around this vertical line would create a three-dimensional shape, which should be a cylinder. \n\nWait, a cylinder has two circular bases and a curved surface. To get a cylinder from a square, I think the side of the square becomes the circumference of the base circle, and the height of the cylinder would be the other dimension of the square. But I need to check if that's correct. Let me think again. If I rotate a square around its vertical line of symmetry, which is the vertical line passing through the center of the square, then each point on the square will trace out a circle. The radius of the base of the cylinder should be half the side length of the square, because the horizontal distance from the center to any side is 7 cm. So the radius would be 7 cm. The height of the cylinder, which is the same as the side length of the square, would be 14 cm. \n\nSo then, the volume of the cylinder can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Plugging in the numbers, that would be \u03c0*(7 cm)\u00b2*(14 cm). Let me compute that step by step. \n\nFirst, square the radius: 7 squared is 49. Then multiply by the height: 49 cm\u00b2 * 14 cm. Let me compute 49 * 14. 49 times 10 is 490, and 49 times 4 is 196. So 490 + 196 equals 686. Therefore, 49 * 14 = 686. Then multiply that by \u03c0: 686\u03c0 cm\u00b3. So the volume is 686\u03c0 cubic centimeters. \n\nWait, let me double-check. The problem states it's a square with side length 14 cm rotated around its vertical line of symmetry. If the rotation is about the vertical line through the center, then the height of the cylinder should indeed be the side length of the square, which is 14 cm. The radius of the cylinder's base is half the side length, which is 7 cm. So volume = \u03c0r\u00b2h = \u03c0*(7)\u00b2*14 = 686\u03c0. That seems right. \n\nBut let me make sure I didn't confuse the height. If the square is rotated around its vertical axis (the line through its center), then the resulting figure's height is the same as the square's side length, yes. So 14 cm. And the radius is indeed half the side length. So all steps check out. Therefore, my answer is 686\u03c0 cm\u00b3. \n\nI'll confirm once more: Volume of the cylinder is \u03c0r\u00b2h. r=7, h=14. 7\u00b2=49, 49*14=686. So yes, 686\u03c0.

The question is asking for the volume of a cylinder formed by rotating a square with side length 14 centimeters about its vertical line of symmetry. I need to find this volume in cubic centimeters and express it in terms of \u03c0. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you rotate a 2D shape around an axis, you get a 3D object. In this case, the square is being rotated around its vertical line of symmetry. Let me visualize this. If the square is oriented with its base on the table, the vertical line of symmetry would go up through the center of the square and down through the opposite center. So, when we rotate it around this vertical axis, it should sweep out a cylindrical shape.\n\nWait, but I need to confirm if this is correct. Let me sketch a square in my mind. Let's say the square has side length 14 cm. Let's imagine the square lying horizontally, with its base on the table. The vertical line of symmetry would be the line passing through the midpoints of the top and bottom sides, right? So if we pivot this square around this vertical axis, it should move up and down, forming a cylinder. The radius of this cylinder would be half the side length of the square, which is 7 cm. The height of the cylinder should also be equal to the side length of the square, which is 14 cm. Therefore, the volume of the cylinder would be \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Substituting the values, that would be \u03c0*(7\u00b2)*(14). Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, compute 7 squared: 7*7 = 49. Then, multiply by 14: 49*14. Hmm, 49*10 is 490 and 49*4 is 196, so 490+196=686. Therefore, the volume is 686\u03c0 cubic centimeters. Wait, but hold on. Let me verify if this model is accurate. If the square is being rotated about its vertical line of symmetry, is the radius really 7 cm? Let me think again.\n\nWhen you rotate a square around its vertical axis, each point on the square moves in a circular path around the vertical axis. The distance from the axis to each point on the square determines the radius of their circular path. The farthest points from the axis would be at the corners of the square. Let me calculate the distance from the vertical line (midpoint of the sides) to one of the corners. The corner is located at (7,14) if we take the square with coordinates from (0,0) to (14,14). The vertical line of symmetry is at x=7. The distance from (7,14) to (7,0) is 14 cm, but that's a point on the top side. Wait, actually, the radius of the cylinder would depend on the maximum distance from the axis. The maximum distance would be from the center to the corner, which is the space diagonal of the square. Let me compute that.\n\nIn a square with side length 14, the space diagonal is 14\u221a2. The vertical line of symmetry passes through the center of the square, which is at (7,7). The distance from the center to any corner is \u221a[(7)^2 + (7)^2] = 7\u221a2. So yes, the radius of the cylinder is 7\u221a2 cm. Then the height of the cylinder is the same as the side length of the square, which is 14 cm. Therefore, the volume would be \u03c0*(7\u221a2)^2*14 = \u03c0*(49*2)*14 = \u03c0*98*14. Let's calculate that. 98*14: 90*14=1260, 8*14=112, so total 1260+112=1372. Therefore, the volume is 1372\u03c0 cm\u00b3. But wait, this contradicts my initial thought where I got 686\u03c0. So which is correct?\n\nHold on, I must have made a mistake in my initial reasoning. Let me go through it again. If the square is rotated around its vertical line of symmetry, the radius of the resulting cylinder should be equal to the distance from the axis (the vertical line through the center) to the outermost point. For a square with side length 14, the distance from the center to a corner is indeed 7\u221a2, as I calculated. Then, the volume is \u03c0*(7\u221a2)^2*14.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the equation to make it clearer:\n\n0.8 = y / (186 + x)\n\nSince y and x are positive integers, this equation has to hold true with those conditions. My goal is to find the smallest x that makes y an integer. So, I need to manipulate the equation to express y in terms of x or some multiple, and then find the minimal x where that results in an integer y.\n\nStarting with the original equation:\n\n0.8 = y / (186 + x)\n\nI can rearrange this equation to solve for y. Multiply both sides by (186 + x):\n\ny = 0.8 * (186 + x)\n\nHmm, okay. Now, since y has to be an integer, the right-hand side must also be an integer. So 0.8 multiplied by (186 + x) must result in an integer. Let me think about how 0.8 relates to fractions of numbers. 0.8 is the same as 4/5. So:\n\ny = (4/5) * (186 + x)\n\nTo have y as an integer, 4/5 multiplied by (186 + x) must be an integer. That means that (186 + x) must be a multiple of 5, right? Because when you have a fraction multiplied by an integer, the result is an integer only if the denominator divides into the numerator without a remainder. So if 4/5 is multiplied by (186 + x), then (186 + x) must be divisible by 5. Hence:\n\n186 + x \u2261 0 mod 5\n\nWhich means that x \u2261 -186 mod 5. Let me compute -186 mod 5. Let's see, 186 divided by 5 is 37 with a remainder of 1, since 37*5=185, so 186 is 185 + 1, which leaves a remainder of 1. Therefore, -186 mod 5 is equivalent to -1 mod 5, which is 4. Therefore:\n\nx \u2261 4 mod 5\n\nSo x must be congruent to 4 modulo 5. That means the smallest positive x that satisfies this is 4. But wait, is that all? Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach this problem by expressing y in terms of x and then looking for the minimal x such that y is an integer. Let's try that.\n\nOriginal equation:\n\n0.8 = y / (186 + x)\n\nMultiply both sides by (186 + x):\n\n0.8*(186 + x) = y\n\nWhich is:\n\ny = 0.8*(186 + x)\n\nBut 0.8 is 4/5, so:\n\ny = (4/5)*(186 + x)\n\nTo have y an integer, (4/5)*(186 + x) must be integer. That requires that 5 divides into 4*(186 + x). Since 4 and 5 are coprime (they share no common factors other than 1), this implies that 5 divides (186 + x). Therefore, 186 + x \u2261 0 mod 5, which brings us back to x \u2261 -186 mod 5. As before, -186 mod 5 is 4. Therefore, x \u2261 4 mod 5. So the smallest x is 4. But let's verify this.\n\nWait, x must be a positive integer such that 186 + x is divisible by 5. Let me check x=4:\n\n186 + 4 = 190, which is 5*38, so yes, divisible by 5. Therefore, y = 0.8*190 = 152. So y=152, which is an integer. Therefore, x=4 is possible. But is there a smaller x? Since x has to be congruent to 4 mod 5, the next smaller x would be 4 -5 = -1, which is negative, so that's invalid. Hence, x=4 is indeed the smallest positive integer satisfying the condition.\n\nBut let me double-check. Let's compute y when x=4:\n\n0.8 = y / (186 + 4) => 0.8 = y / 190 => y =", 0.5099999904632568], ["25", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

So, the problem says that if 0.8 equals y divided by (186 + x), we need to find the smallest value of x where both x and y are positive integers. Hmm, alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, let me write down the equation properly. The problem states:\n\n0.8 = y / (186 + x)\n\nSo, 0.8 is a decimal, which can be converted to a fraction. Since 0.8 is 8/10, maybe that's easier to work with. Let me write that down:\n\ny / (186 + x) = 8/10\n\nTo solve for y, I can set up a proportion. If two fractions are equal, their cross products should be equal. So, cross-multiplying would give me:\n\ny = (8/10) * (186 + x)\n\nHmm, but maybe it's better to just rearrange the equation to solve for x. Let's try that. Starting from:\n\ny = 0.8 * (186 + x)\n\nSince y has to be an integer, we need 0.8 multiplied by (186 + x) to result in an integer. Let me think about that. 0.8 is equivalent to 4/5, right? So:\n\n4/5 * (186 + x) = y\n\nTo make y an integer, the product (4/5)*(186 + x) must be an integer. Therefore, 186 + x must be a multiple of 5, because 4 and 5 are coprime, so 5 needs to divide into (186 + x). Let me explain that. If 4/5 of something is an integer, that something must be a multiple of 5. So, 186 + x = 5k, where k is an integer.\n\nTherefore, substituting back:\n\ny = (4/5)*(5k) = 4k. So, y = 4k and x = 5k - 186. But then x must also be positive. So, 5k - 186 > 0 \u2192 5k > 186 \u2192 k > 186/5 = 37.2. Since k must be an integer (as y is an integer because x and y are integers, and k = y/4, so y must be divisible by 4, but since y is an integer, k must be an integer. Wait, hold on. Wait, if y = (4/5)*(186 + x), then y must be a multiple of 4/5, but y is an integer. So, (4/5)*(186 + x) must be an integer. Therefore, (186 + x) must be divisible by 5/4, but that might not make sense. Wait, maybe I need to re-examine this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think of 0.8 as 4/5. Then, for (4/5)*(186 + x) to be an integer, (186 + x) must be a multiple of 5. Because 4 and 5 are coprime, so 5 divides into (186 + x). Therefore, 186 + x = 5k, where k is a positive integer. So, x = 5k - 186. Then, x must be positive, so 5k - 186 > 0 \u2192 5k > 186 \u2192 k > 186/5 = 37.2. Therefore, the smallest integer k is 38. Then, substituting back, x = 5*38 - 186. Let me compute that: 5*38 is 190, so 190 - 186 = 4. So, x = 4. Let me check if that works. If x = 4, then y = 0.8*(186 + 4) = 0.8*190 = 152. Since y must be an integer, 152 is indeed an integer. So, that works. Therefore, the smallest x is 4.\n\nWait, let me verify once again. So, starting from 0.8 = y/(186 + x). So, cross-multiplying, y = 0.8*(186 + x). Then, 0.8 can be written as 4/5, so y = (4/5)*(186 + x).

To make it easier, maybe I can eliminate the decimal by multiplying both sides by the denominator. Let's see. If I multiply both sides by (186 + x), that should give me y = 0.8 * (186 + x).

Let's express 0.8 as a fraction instead of a decimal to see if that helps. 0.8 is the same as 4/5. So substituting that in, we have y = (4/5) * (186 + x). Therefore, (4/5)(186 + x) must be an integer. That implies that (186 + x) must be divisible by 5, right? Because if you multiply 4 by something and divide by 5, the result is an integer only if the numerator is divisible by 5. Wait, let's confirm that.\n\nIf y = (4/5)(186 + x), then 186 + x must be a multiple of 5 because 4 and 5 are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1). So, 186 + x is 5 times some integer k, where k is a positive integer since x and y are positive integers. Therefore, x = 5k - 186. But x must be a positive integer, so 5k - 186 > 0. That means 5k > 186, so k must be greater than 186/5. Let's compute 186 divided by 5. 5*37 is 185, so 186/5 is 37.2. Therefore, k must be at least 38. Because if k=37, then 5*37=185, which would make x=185 - 186= -1, which is not allowed since x has to be a positive integer. So k starts at 38. \n\nTherefore, the smallest possible k is 38, which would give x=5*38 - 186. Let me calculate that. 5*38 is 190, so 190 - 186 = 4. So x would be 4. Let me check if that works. Then, y would be (4/5)*(186 + 4) = (4/5)*190 = 4*38 = 152. So, y is 152, which is an integer. Since both x and y are positive integers, that checks out. \n\nWait, but let me go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with 0.8 = y/(186 + x). Multiply both sides by (186 + x): y = 0.8*(186 + x). Convert 0.8 to a fraction: y = (4/5)*(186 + x). For y to be an integer, (186 + x) must be divisible by 5, which makes (186 + x) = 5k for some integer k. Then, x = 5k - 186. Since x must be positive, 5k - 186 > 0 => k > 37.2. So the smallest integer k is 38. Then, x = 5*38 - 186 = 190 - 186 = 4. Then y = (4/5)*(186 + 4) = (4/5)*190 = 4*38 = 152. Yep, both are integers. So that seems correct. \n\nWait a second, let me check if k can be lower. If k=37, then x=5*37 - 186 = 185 - 186 = -1, which is invalid. So k must be 38. So x=4 is indeed the minimum. \n\nBut let me also check if there's another way to", 0.5099999904632568], ["25", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

I need to find the smallest value of x such that 0.8 is equal to y divided by (186 + x), where x and y are positive integers. Hmm, okay. Let me start by writing down the equation properly.\n\nThe equation is 0.8 = y / (186 + x). I need to solve for y and x here, but since they have to be positive integers, maybe I can rearrange the equation to find possible values of x and y.\n\nFirst, let's convert 0.8 into a fraction to make it easier. 0.8 is the same as 4/5. So, if I write that equation out, I get 4/5 = y / (186 + x). That means that y is equal to 4/5 times (186 + x). Since y has to be an integer, the right-hand side has to be a fraction that simplifies to an integer. Let's see how that fraction can be an integer.\n\nGiven that y is an integer, (186 + x) must be a multiple of 5. Because 4/5 times something is an integer only if that something is a multiple of 5. So, 186 + x = 5k, where k is a positive integer. Wait, but x has to be positive, so k must be at least such that 186 + x is positive. Since x is positive, 186 + x is at least 187, so 5k is at least 187, which would mean k is at least 187/5, which is 37.4. So k must be an integer greater than or equal to 38.\n\nBut let me check that again. Let me think again. If (186 + x) * (4/5) is an integer, then (186 + x) must be a multiple of 5. Let me verify that. Let's suppose that 4/5 * (186 + x) is an integer. Let's call that integer y. So:\n\ny = (4/5)(186 + x)\n\nMultiply both sides by 5:\n\n5y = 4(186 + x)\n\nSo 5y = 744 + 4x\n\nRearranging:\n\n4x = 5y - 744\n\nTherefore:\n\nx = (5y - 744)/4\n\nSince x must be a positive integer, (5y - 744) must be divisible by 4 and the result must be positive. Let's note that 5y - 744 must be a positive multiple of 4.\n\nSo, 5y \u2261 744 mod 4\n\nBut 744 divided by 4 is 186, so 744 is divisible by 4. Therefore, 5y \u2261 0 mod 4. Which implies that 5y \u2261 0 mod 4. But 5 and 4 are coprime, so 5 has a multiplicative inverse mod 4. Since 5 \u2261 1 mod 4, the inverse is 1. Therefore, y \u2261 0 mod 4.\n\nSo y must be a multiple of 4. Let me write that down:\n\nLet y = 4m, where m is a positive integer.\n\nThen substituting back into the equation:\n\nx = (5*(4m) - 744)/4\n\nSimplify:\n\nx = (20m - 744)/4\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 4:\n\nx = (5m - 186)/1\n\nSo x = 5m - 186\n\nSince x must be a positive integer, we have:\n\n5m - 186 > 0\n\nSo:\n\n5m > 186\n\n=> m > 186/5\n\n186 divided by 5 is 37.2, so m must be at least 38.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of m is 38. Then x = 5*38 - 186 = 190 - 186 = 4. So x=4.\n\nLet me check this. If x=4, then 186 + x = 190. Then y would be 4/5 * 190 = 152. So y=152. Both are positive integers. So that works.\n\nWait, but the question says \"find the smallest value of x\". So according to this, x=4. Let me check if that's the smallest. Let's check m=38, x=4.

So:\n\n\\( 0.8 \\times 186 = 148.8 \\)\n\nHmm, so substituting back into the equation:\n\n\\( y = 148.8 + 0.8x \\)\n\nSo, \\( y = 148.8 + 0.8x \\). But since \\( y \\) needs to be an integer, the term \\( 0.8x \\) must make the total sum an integer.

Let me write the equation again using fractions:\n\n\\( 0.8 = \\frac{4}{5} \\), so:\n\n\\( \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{y}{186 + x} \\)\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n\\( 4 \\times (186 + x) = 5y \\)\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n\\( 4 \\times 186 + 4x = 5y \\)\n\nCalculating \\( 4 \\times 186 \\):\n\n186 multiplied by 4. Let's do that:\n\n180 times 4 is 720, and 6 times 4 is 24, so total is 744.\n\nSo:\n\n\\( 4x + 744 = 5y \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( 5y = 4x + 744 \\). Since \\( 5y \\) must be a multiple of 5, and \\( 4x + 744 \\) must also be a multiple of 5. So let's check the congruence:\n\n\\( 4x + 744 \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 \\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\( 4x \\equiv -744 \\mod 5 \\)\n\nBut \\( -744 \\equiv 1 \\mod 5 \\) because 744 divided by 5 is 148*5 = 740, so 744 - 740 = 4, so -744 is -4, which is equivalent to 1 mod 5 (since -4 + 5 = 1). Therefore:\n\n\\( 4x \\equiv 1 \\mod 5 \\)\n\nNow, we need to solve for x in this congruence. Let's find the multiplicative inverse of 4 modulo 5. The inverse of 4 mod 5 is the number m such that 4m \u2261 1 mod 5.\n\nTesting m=4: 4*4=16 \u2261 1 mod 5. Yes, 16 divided by 5 is 3 with remainder 1. So the inverse is 4.\n\nTherefore, multiplying both sides by 4:\n\n\\( x \u2261 1 * 4 \u2261 4 mod 5 \\)\n\nSo x must be congruent to 4 modulo 5. That means x can be written as \\( x = 5k + 4 \\) for some integer k \u2265 0.

The equation given is 0.8 equals y divided by (186 plus x), and we need to find the smallest possible integer value of x that makes both x and y positive integers. Hmm, let me write that down clearly first:\n\n0.8 = y / (186 + x)\n\nAlright, so our goal is to express this equation in a way that allows us to find integers x and y. Since 0.8 is a decimal, maybe converting it to a fraction would be helpful here. Let me think... 0.8 is the same as 4/5 because 4 divided by 5 equals 0.8. Yes, that seems right. So the equation can be rewritten as:\n\n4/5 = y / (186 + x)\n\nNow, if I cross-multiply to eliminate the fraction, we get:\n\n4 * (186 + x) = 5y\n\nSo that's 4*(186 + x) = 5y. Now, since x and y must be positive integers, 186 + x must also be a positive integer. Let me check that. 186 is already positive, and x is positive, so 186 + x will definitely be positive. That makes sense.\n\nSo the equation simplifies to 5y = 4*(186 + x). Let me rearrange this equation to express y in terms of x. If we do that, we get:\n\ny = (4/5)*(186 + x)\n\nBut wait, the problem says that y must be a positive integer. So (4/5)*(186 + x) has to result in an integer. That means 186 + x must be divisible by 5, because 4 and 5 are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1). Therefore, 5 divides (186 + x). So, 186 + x \u2261 0 mod 5.\n\nLet me verify that. If we have a number divisible by 5, then its remainder when divided by 5 is zero. So, (186 + x) mod 5 = 0. Therefore, x must be congruent to ( -186 mod 5 ). Let me compute that. Let's find 186 divided by 5. 5*37=185, so 186 is 185 +1, which is 4 mod 5. So 186 mod 5 is 4, which means (186 + x) mod 5 = (4 + x) mod 5. Therefore, 4 + x \u2261 0 mod 5. So x \u2261 (-4) mod 5, which is equivalent to x \u2261 1 mod 5. Because -4 +5=1, so x must be congruent to 1 modulo 5.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of x is the smallest positive integer such that x \u2261 1 mod 5. The smallest such positive integer is 1. Let me check if x=1 works. Let's substitute x=1 into the equation.\n\nIf x=1, then 186 +1=187. So y=4/5*187. Let's compute 187*4 first. 187*4: 180*4=720, 7*4=28, so 720+28=748. Then 748/5=149.6. But y has to be an integer. Hmm, that's a problem. So y is not an integer when x=1. That's bad.\n\nSo x=1 is invalid. Then, the next possible x should be 1+5=6. Let's check x=6. Then 186+6=192. Then y=4/5*192. Let's compute that. 192*4=768. 768/5=153.6. Still not an integer. Hmm, so y is 153.6. Not good. Next x=11: 186+11=197. Then y=4*197/5. 197*4=788. 788 divided by 5. 5*157=785, so remainder 3. So y=157.6, still not an integer.

The equation given is 0.8 = y / (186 + x), and we need to find the smallest possible value of x, where both x and y are positive integers. Hmm, let's start by understanding what the equation means and how to approach it.\n\nFirst, let me rewrite the equation to make it easier to work with. The equation is 0.8 equals y divided by (186 + x). So, if I multiply both sides by (186 + x), I can rearrange the equation to find a relationship between x and y. Let's do that:\n\n0.8 * (186 + x) = y\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n\n0.8 * 186 + 0.8 * x = y\n\nCalculating 0.8 times 186. Let me do that. 0.8 multiplied by 186. Well, 0.8 is the same as 4/5, so multiplying by 4/5 of 186. Let's compute that:\n\n4 * 186 = 744\n\nThen divide by 5: 744 / 5 = 148.8\n\nSo, 0.8 * 186 = 148.8\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\n148.8 + 0.8x = y\n\nBut since x and y are positive integers, and y has to be an integer, this equation suggests that 148.8 + 0.8x must result in an integer. Let me note this down.\n\nSo, 148.8 + 0.8x is equal to y. Let's express 0.8 as a fraction to make it clearer. 0.8 is 4/5, so:\n\n148.8 + (4/5)x = y\n\nSince 148.8 is the same as 148 + 0.8, which is 148 + 4/5, so:\n\n148 + 4/5 + (4/5)x = y\n\nTo have y as an integer, the sum of these terms must result in an integer. Let's combine the terms with x. Let's factor out 4/5:\n\n148 + (4/5)(1 + x) = y\n\nSo, (4/5)(1 + x) must be an integer because 148 is already an integer and we need the entire right-hand side to be an integer. Therefore, (4/5)(1 + x) must be an integer. Let's denote k as an integer such that:\n\n(4/5)(x + 1) = k\n\nMultiplying both sides by 5:\n\n4(x + 1) = 5k\n\nSo, 4(x + 1) must be divisible by 5. Therefore, 4(x + 1) is a multiple of 5. Let's write that as:\n\n4(x + 1) \u2261 0 mod 5\n\nWhich means that 4(x + 1) modulo 5 is 0. To solve for x, we can find x such that (x + 1) is a multiple of 5, since 4 and 5 are coprime (their gcd is 1). Therefore, (x + 1) must be divisible by 5. Let's denote:\n\nx + 1 = 5m, where m is a positive integer (since x is positive). Therefore:\n\nx = 5m - 1\n\nSo, x has to be of the form 5m - 1, where m is a positive integer. Then, x is 4, 9, 14, etc., as we start from m=1,2,3,...\n\nNow, substituting x = 5m - 1 into the equation:\n\ny = 148.8 + 0.8x = 148.8 + 0.8*(5m - 1)\n\nLet's compute that:\n\nFirst, 0.8*(5m - 1) = 4m - 0.8\n\nSo, y = 148.8 + 4m - 0.8 = (148.8 - 0.8) + 4m = 148 + 4m\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, y = 148 + 4m. Since m must be a positive integer (as x = 5m - 1 must be positive, so m \u2265 1), let's check:\n\nIf m = 1, then x = 5*1 -1 = 4, and y = 148", 0.38999998569488525], ["25", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, the equation involves absolute values nested inside another absolute value. This might get a bit complicated, but I think breaking it down into cases can help. Let me recall that when dealing with nested absolute values, it's often helpful to consider the different intervals where the expressions inside the absolute values are positive or negative. \n\nSo, for the equation \\( x = \\left|2x - |60 - 2x|\\right| \\), the inner absolute value is \\( |60 - 2x| \\). Let's analyze when \\( 60 - 2x \\) is non-negative and when it's negative. That is, when \\( 60 - 2x \\geq 0 \\) and when \\( 60 - 2x < 0 \\). \n\nSolving \\( 60 - 2x \\geq 0 \\):\n\\( 60 \\geq 2x \\)\n\\( x \\leq 30 \\)\n\nSimilarly, \\( 60 - 2x < 0 \\) gives \\( x > 30 \\). So, the expression \\( |60 - 2x| \\) will be equal to \\( 60 - 2x \\) when \\( x \\leq 30 \\), and \\( 2x - 60 \\) when \\( x > 30 \\). \n\nTherefore, we can split the original equation into two cases based on whether \\( x \\leq 30 \\) or \\( x > 30 \\). Let's handle each case separately.\n\n**Case 1: \\( x \\leq 30 \\)**\n\nIn this case, \\( |60 - 2x| = 60 - 2x \\). Plugging this back into the equation:\n\n\\( x = \\left|2x - (60 - 2x)\\right| \\)\nSimplify inside the absolute value:\n\\( x = \\left|2x - 60 + 2x\\right| \\)\nCombine like terms:\n\\( x = \\left|4x - 60\\right| \\)\n\nSo, now the equation is \\( x = |4x - 60| \\). Let's solve this equation here. \n\nFirst, the absolute value equation \\( |4x - 60| = x \\). This equation can be split into two possibilities:\n\na) \\( 4x - 60 = x \\)\nb) \\( -(4x - 60) = x \\)\n\nSolving case a):\n\n\\( 4x - 60 = x \\)\nSubtract x from both sides:\n\\( 3x - 60 = 0 \\)\nAdd 60 to both sides:\n\\( 3x = 60 \\)\nDivide by 3:\n\\( x = 20 \\)\n\nThen check if \\( x = 20 \\) satisfies the original equation in this case. Since in Case 1 we assumed \\( x \\leq 30 \\), and 20 is indeed \u226430, this is valid. So, one solution is 20.\n\nSolving case b):\n\n\\( -(4x - 60) = x \\)\nExpand the left side:\n\\( -4x + 60 = x \\)\nAdd 4x to both sides:\n\\( 60 = 5x \\)\nDivide by 5:\n\\( x = 12 \\)\n\nAgain, check if 12 \u226430? Yes, so x=12 is also valid in this case. Therefore, in Case 1 (x \u226430), we have solutions x=20 and x=12.\n\n**Case 2: \\( x > 30 \\)**\n\nHere, \\( |60 - 2x| = 2x - 60 \\). Plug this into the original equation:\n\n\\( x = \\left|2x - (2x - 60)\\right| \\)\nSimplify inside the absolute value:\n\\( x = |2x - 2x + 60| \\)\nSimplify:\n\\( x = |60| \\)\nWhich simplifies to:\n\\( x = 60 \\)\n\nBut wait, here we assumed \\( x > 30 \\). However, 60 is indeed greater than 30, so x=60 is a valid solution in this case.\n\nTherefore, in Case 2, we have only x=60 as a solution.\n\nSo, compiling all solutions from both cases:\n- From Case 1: x=20 and x=12\n-", 0.4300000071525574], ["25", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Hmm, absolute value equations can sometimes be tricky, so I need to break this down carefully.\n\nFirst, I should handle the inner absolute value, which is \\( |60 - 2x| \\). Let me write that down:\n\n\\( x = |2x - |60 - 2x|| \\)\n\nSo, the first step is to consider the expression inside the first absolute value: \\( 2x - |60 - 2x| \\). Wait, but actually, the entire equation is the outer absolute value of that expression. Let me clarify:\n\nThe equation is \\( x = |2x - |60 - 2x|| \\). So, the left side is x, and the right side is the absolute value of \\( 2x - |60 - 2x| \\). Therefore, I need to solve this equation by considering the possible cases based on the expressions inside the absolute values.\n\nLet me start by defining two separate cases for the inner absolute value \\( |60 - 2x| \\). That is, when \\( 60 - 2x \\geq 0 \\) and when \\( 60 - 2x < 0 \\). Solving \\( 60 - 2x \\geq 0 \\):\n\n\\( 60 \\geq 2x \\)\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\( 30 \\geq x \\) or \\( x \\leq 30 \\)\n\nSo, if \\( x \\leq 30 \\), then \\( |60 - 2x| = 60 - 2x \\). Otherwise, if \\( x > 30 \\), then \\( |60 - 2x| = -(60 - 2x) = 2x - 60 \\). Therefore, I can split the problem into two cases: one where \\( x \\leq 30 \\) and another where \\( x > 30 \\). Let's do that.\n\n**Case 1: \\( x \\leq 30 \\)**\n\nIn this case, \\( |60 - 2x| = 60 - 2x \\). Substitute this into the original equation:\n\n\\( x = |2x - (60 - 2x)| \\)\n\nSimplify the expression inside the absolute value:\n\n\\( 2x - (60 - 2x) = 2x - 60 + 2x = 4x - 60 \\)\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\( x = |4x - 60| \\)\n\nNow, we need to solve \\( x = |4x - 60| \\). This again splits into two cases based on the expression inside the absolute value: \\( 4x - 60 \\geq 0 \\) and \\( 4x - 60 < 0 \\).\n\n**Subcase 1a: \\( x \\leq 30 \\) and \\( 4x - 60 \\geq 0 \\)**\n\nThat is, when \\( x \\leq 30 \\), but also \\( 4x - 60 \\geq 0 \\Rightarrow x \\geq 15 \\). So combining these, \\( 15 \\leq x \\leq 30 \\). In this interval, \\( |4x - 60| = 4x - 60 \\).\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\( x = 4x - 60 \\)\n\nSubtract x from both sides:\n\n\\( 0 = 3x - 60 \\)\n\nAdd 60 to both sides:\n\n\\( 3x = 60 \\)\n\nDivide by 3:\n\n\\( x = 20 \\)\n\nBut we need to check if this x is within our current interval. Since \\( 15 \\leq x \\leq 30 \\), x=20 is valid here. So one solution is x=20.\n\n**Subcase 1b: \\( x \\leq 30 \\) and \\( 4x - 60 < 0 \\)**\n\nWhich is when \\( x < 15 \\). In this interval, \\( |4x - 60| = -(4x - 60) = 60 - 4x \\).\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\( x = 60 - 4x \\)\n\nAdd 4x to both sides:\n\n\\( 5x = 60 \\)\n\nDivide by 5:\n\n\\( x = 12 \\)\n\nCheck if this is in the interval x", 0.46000000834465027], ["25", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

I need to solve the equation x = |2x - |60 - 2x|| and find the sum of all solutions. Hmm, absolute value equations can be tricky because of the cases involved. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the equation is x = |2x - |60 - 2x||. Let me call the inner absolute value |60 - 2x| as A for simplicity. So the equation becomes x = |2x - A| where A = |60 - 2x|. So now, inside the outer absolute value, we have 2x - A. To solve this, I need to consider different cases based on the expression inside the absolute value, which is 2x - |60 - 2x|.\n\nSo let's denote B = |60 - 2x|. Then the equation is x = |2x - B|. Now, B itself is an absolute value, so maybe I need to split into cases based on whether 60 - 2x is non-negative or negative. That is, depending on the value of x.\n\nLet me first find the critical points for 60 - 2x. Setting 60 - 2x = 0 gives x = 30. So, the critical point is at x = 30. For x < 30, 60 - 2x is positive, and for x \u2265 30, it's non-positive. Therefore, the expression inside the inner absolute value |60 - 2x| can be split into two cases:\n\nCase 1: x < 30. Then |60 - 2x| = 60 - 2x. So substituting back into B, B = 60 - 2x.\n\nCase 2: x \u2265 30. Then |60 - 2x| = -(60 - 2x) = 2x - 60. So substituting back, B = 2x - 60.\n\nTherefore, the equation x = |2x - B| splits into two subcases based on these cases.\n\nLet me handle each case separately.\n\n**Case 1: x < 30**\n\nIn this case, B = 60 - 2x. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\nx = |2x - (60 - 2x)|\n\nSimplify inside the absolute value:\n\n2x - (60 - 2x) = 2x - 60 + 2x = 4x - 60\n\nTherefore, the equation is x = |4x - 60|\n\nSo now we have x = |4x - 60|. Let me split this into two subcases based on the expression inside the absolute value: 4x - 60.\n\nWait, but the absolute value here is |4x - 60|. Let's define C = 4x - 60. So the equation is x = |C|, where C = 4x - 60. But we also need to consider the critical points for C. Setting C = 0 gives 4x - 60 = 0 => x = 15.\n\nSo the expression inside the absolute value C = 4x - 60 can be split into two cases:\n\nSubcase 1a: 4x - 60 \u2265 0 => x \u2265 15\n\nSubcase 1b: 4x - 60 < 0 => x < 15\n\nBut in our original Case 1, x < 30. So, combining the two, in Case 1, x can be in different subcases depending on where x is relative to 15 and 30.\n\nSo let's handle this step by step.\n\n**Subcase 1a: x \u2265 15 and x < 30**\n\nHere, both x \u2265 15 and x < 30 are in Case 1. So, in this subcase, the equation is x = |4x - 60|.\n\nBut we need to split this into further subcases based on the value of x relative to 15 and 30. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, let's consider the equation x = |4x - 60|.\n\nLet me solve this equation. Let's consider:\n\nx = |4x - 60|\n\nThis equation can be rewritten as:\n\nEither 4x - 60 = x or -(4x - 60) = x\n\nSo solving both possibilities:\n\nFirst equation: 4x - 60 = x => 4x - x = 60 => 3x = 60 => x = 20\n\nSecond equation: -4", 0.38999998569488525], ["25", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

I need to find the sum of all solutions to the equation x equals the absolute value of (2x minus the absolute value of (60 minus 2x)). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated with nested absolute values. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the equation is x = |2x - |60 - 2x||. Let's start by simplifying the inner absolute value. The inner absolute value is |60 - 2x|. I remember that absolute value expressions can be split into cases based on the sign of the expression inside. So, 60 - 2x can be positive or negative, depending on the value of x. Let me write that out.\n\nCase 1: 60 - 2x \u2265 0. This happens when 60 \u2265 2x, so x \u2264 30.\n\nCase 2: 60 - 2x < 0. That is when 60 < 2x, so x > 30.\n\nSo, depending on whether x is less than or equal to 30 or greater than 30, the inner absolute value |60 - 2x| will be either 60 - 2x or 2x - 60 respectively.\n\nTherefore, I can substitute this into the original equation. Let's split into two cases based on x \u2264 30 and x > 30.\n\nCase 1: x \u2264 30. Then |60 - 2x| = 60 - 2x. So, the original equation becomes x = |2x - (60 - 2x)|. Let's simplify this.\n\nFirst, inside the absolute value: 2x - (60 - 2x) = 2x - 60 + 2x = 4x - 60. So, x = |4x - 60|.\n\nNow, we have to consider two subcases here because 4x - 60 can be positive or negative.\n\nSubcase 1a: 4x - 60 \u2265 0. That is, 4x \u2265 60 => x \u2265 15. Since in this case we're considering x \u2264 30, this subcase applies when 15 \u2264 x \u2264 30.\n\nSubcase 1b: 4x - 60 < 0. That is, x < 15. But in this case, we're in Subcase 1a (x \u2264 30), so if x < 15, this would mean x < 15, which is already covered.\n\nSo, let's first handle Subcase 1a: 15 \u2264 x \u2264 30. Here, |4x - 60| = 60 - 4x. Therefore, the equation becomes x = 60 - 4x.\n\nSolving for x: x + 4x = 60 => 5x = 60 => x = 12.\n\nBut wait, x = 12. Let me check if this is within x \u2264 30. Yes, 12 is less than 30, so x = 12 is valid here. So, x = 12 is a solution in Subcase 1a.\n\nNow, Subcase 1b: x < 15. Then |4x - 60| = 4x - 60. So, our equation is x = 4x - 60. Solving for x: x - 4x = -60 => -3x = -60 => x = 20.\n\nBut wait, x = 20 is greater than 15, which is not in Subcase 1b (x < 15). So, this solution is invalid here. Therefore, no solution in Subcase 1b.\n\nTherefore, in Case 1 (x \u2264 30), the only solution is x = 12.\n\nNow, moving to Case 2: x > 30. Then |60 - 2x| = 2x - 60. So, substituting into the original equation: x = |2x - (2x - 60)|. Let's simplify inside the absolute value:\n\n2x - (2x - 60) = 2x - 2x + 60 = 60. So, x = |60|. Which is x = 60.\n\nBut wait, in Case 2, we assumed x > 30. Does x = 60 satisfy x > 30? Yes. So, x = 60 is a solution here.\n\nTherefore, in Case 2, the only solution", 0.38999998569488525], ["25", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated because there are absolute values nested inside each other. I need to be careful with the order of operations here. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me rewrite the equation to make sure I understand it correctly. The equation is x equals the absolute value of (2x minus the absolute value of (60 minus 2x)). So, it's x = |2x - |60 - 2x||. Alright.\n\nTo solve an equation with absolute values, it's usually best to consider the different cases where the expressions inside the absolute values are either positive or negative. But here, the inner absolute value is |60 - 2x| and the outer one is |2x - |60 - 2x||. So, maybe I need to split into cases based on the value of x, right?\n\nLet me first consider the inner absolute value |60 - 2x|. The expression inside is 60 - 2x, which changes sign depending on whether 60 - 2x is positive or negative. So, 60 - 2x > 0 when x < 30, and 60 - 2x < 0 when x \u2265 30. So, I can split the problem into two cases based on x < 30 and x \u2265 30.\n\nBut before that, let me also consider the outer absolute value |2x - |60 - 2x||. Let's let's denote A = |60 - 2x|. Then the equation becomes x = |2x - A|. So, maybe it's helpful to substitute A into the equation. That way, instead of dealing with two absolute value functions nested, I can handle each case separately for x < 30 and x \u2265 30.\n\nSo, substituting A = |60 - 2x| into the original equation, we have:\n\nx = |2x - A|\n\nSo, now we have two cases: x < 30 and x \u2265 30. Let's handle each case separately.\n\n**Case 1: x < 30**\n\nIn this case, A = |60 - 2x|. Let's determine the sign of 60 - 2x. For x < 30, 2x < 60, so 60 - 2x > 0. Therefore, A = 60 - 2x. So, substituting back into the equation:\n\nx = |2x - (60 - 2x)| = |2x - 60 + 2x| = |4x - 60|\n\nSo, x = |4x - 60|. Now, solve |4x - 60| = x. Let's break this into two subcases:\n\n**Subcase 1a: 4x - 60 \u2265 0**\n\nThis implies 4x \u2265 60 \u2192 x \u2265 15. But in our current case, x < 30. So, combining x \u2265 15 and x < 30, we have 15 \u2264 x < 30.\n\nIn this subcase, |4x - 60| = 4x - 60. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\nx = 4x - 60 \u2192 x - 4x = -60 \u2192 -3x = -60 \u2192 x = 20\n\nBut since this is in the subcase where x \u2265 15, x = 20 is valid (since 20 \u2265 15). So, x = 20 is a solution in this subcase.\n\n**Subcase 1b: 4x - 60 < 0**\n\nThis implies x < 15, but since we are in this case where x < 30, this is automatically true. So, in this subcase, |4x - 60| = -(4x - 60) = 60 - 4x. Then, the equation becomes:\n\nx = 60 - 4x \u2192 x + 4x = 60 \u2192 5x = 60 \u2192 x = 12\n\nBut x = 12 is less than 15, so x = 12 is valid. So, x = 12 is another solution.\n\nTherefore, in Case 1 (x < 30), the solutions are x = 12 and x = 20.\n\n**Case 2: x \u2265 30**\n\nIn this case, A = |60 - 2x|.

So, I can split into two cases: when 60 - 2x \u2265 0 and when 60 - 2x < 0.\n\n**Case 1:** 60 - 2x \u2265 0 \u21d2 2x \u2264 60 \u21d2 x \u2264 30.\n\nIn this case, y = 60 - 2x.\n\nSubstituting back into the original equation, we have:\n\nx = |2x - (60 - 2x)| = |2x - 60 + 2x| = |4x - 60|.\n\nSo, x = |4x - 60|. Now, this is a simpler equation with one absolute value. Let's solve it.\n\nAgain, split into two subcases for |4x - 60|.\n\n**Subcase 1a:** 4x - 60 \u2265 0 \u21d2 4x \u2265 60 \u21d2 x \u2265 15.\n\nThen, x = 4x - 60 \u21d2 x - 4x = -60 \u21d2 -3x = -60 \u21d2 x = 20.\n\nBut we need to check if this solution satisfies the subcase condition x \u2265 15. Since 20 \u2265 15, it's valid.\n\n**Subcase 1b:** 4x - 60 < 0 \u21d2 4x < 60 \u21d2 x < 15.\n\nThen, x = -(4x - 60) \u21d2 x = -4x + 60 \u21d2 x + 4x = 60 \u21d2 5x = 60 \u21d2 x = 12.\n\nCheck if x = 12 satisfies the subcase condition x < 15. Yes, it does. So x = 12 is valid here.\n\nSo in Case 1 (x \u2264 30), we have two solutions: x = 20 and x = 12.\n\n**Case 2:** 60 - 2x < 0 \u21d2 2x > 60 \u21d2 x > 30.\n\nSo here, y = 2x - 60.\n\nSubstitute back into the equation:\n\nx = |2x - (2x - 60)| = |2x - 2x + 60| = |60| = 60.\n\nSo, in this case, x must equal 60.

In this case, the inner absolute value |60 - 2x| = 60 - 2x. Then the equation becomes x = |2x - (60 - 2x)| = |2x -60 + 2x| = |4x -60|.\n\nSo, in this case, the equation is x = |4x -60|. Now, another absolute value equation: |4x -60|. Let me consider two subcases here.\n\n**Subcase 1a: 4x -60 \u2265 0 \u2192 4x \u226560 \u2192 x \u226515**\n\nThen |4x -60| = 4x -60. So the equation becomes x = 4x -60. Solving for x: x -4x = -60 \u2192 -3x = -60 \u2192 x = 20. But wait, in this case, we're in Subcase 1a where x \u226515. x=20 is definitely in that range, so this is a valid solution. So one solution here is x=20.\n\n**Subcase 1b: 4x -60 <0 \u2192 4x <60 \u2192 x <15**\n\nThen |4x -60| = -(4x -60) = -4x +60. So the equation becomes x = -4x +60. Solving: x +4x =60 \u21925x=60\u2192x=12. But we are in Subcase 1b where x <15. 12 is less than15, so this is valid. So another solution here is x=12.\n\nSo in Case 1, the solutions are x=20 and x=12.\n\n**Case 2: 60 -2x <0**\n\nThis implies that 2x >60 \u2192x>30.

So the equation becomes x = |60| \u2192x=60.\n\nBut remember that in this case, x>30, and 60 is greater than30, so x=60 is indeed a valid solution. So another solution is x=60.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me check again. Let me verify if x=60 satisfies the original equation.\n\nOriginal equation: x = |2x - |60 -2x||. Let's compute each step:\n\nx=60. Then 2x=120. 60 -2x=60 -120= -60. The inner absolute value is |-60|=60. Then 2x - inner absolute value=120 -60=60. Absolute value of 60 is 60. So x=60 =60. Correct. So x=60 is valid.\n\nSo all solutions are x=12,20,60.\n\nWait, let me double-check Subcase 1a and 1b. In Subcase 1a, we had x=20, which is okay because x=20 is less than30, so x>30 is not satisfied here, so that's okay. Similarly, in Subcase 1b, x=12 is less than15, which is okay. So both solutions are in their respective cases.\n\nSo total solutions are x=12,20,60. Sum is 12 +20 +60=92.\n\nWait, so is that the final answer?

I need to figure out how many primes are in this list: 43, 4343, 434343, and so on. Hmm, so the pattern here is that each number is formed by repeating the digits 43 multiple times. Let me write down the first few terms to get a better idea.\n\nFirst term: 43\n\nSecond term: 4343\n\nThird term: 434343\n\nFourth term: 43434343\n\nAnd so on. Each subsequent term is the previous one followed by another 43. So a general term can be represented as a number made up of 'n' copies of 43. For example, the second term has two 43s, the third term has three 43s, etc.\n\nI need to check which of these numbers are prime. Primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. So I need to check if any of these repeating 43s are prime.\n\nLet me start by checking the first few terms manually.\n\nFirst term: 43. Is 43 a prime number? Yes, because its only divisors are 1 and 43. So 43 is prime.\n\nSecond term: 4343. Let's see if this is prime. The first step is to check if it's even, which it's not. Then check divisibility by 3: 4+3+4+3 = 14, which is not divisible by 3, so not divisible by 3. Next, check divisibility by 5: ends with 3, so no. Next, check primes up to its square root. The square root of 4343 is approximately 65.9, so we need to check primes up to 67.\n\nCheck divisibility by 7: 4343 divided by 7. 7*600=4200, 4343-4200=143. 7*20=140, so 7*620=4340, 143-140=3.

Let me start by understanding the pattern here. The numbers seem to be alternating 4 and 3, right? Let me verify:\n\nThe first one is 43. Then the second is 4343. Third is 434343. Yeah, each subsequent number adds an extra pair of 4 and 3. So each time, the length of the number doubles. Starting from 2 digits, then 4 digits, 6 digits, etc. So the nth number has 2n digits. \n\nI need to check if any of these numbers are prime. Let's recall that a prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, to determine if any of these numbers are prime, I need to check their divisibility.\n\nStarting with the first few examples:\n\n1. 43: This is a two-digit number. Let me check if 43 is prime. 43 divided by 2 is 21.5, not an integer. Divided by 3: 3*14=42, so remainder 1. Divided by 5: ends with a 3, so no. So 43 is prime? Wait, but let me check 43's divisibility. 43 divided by 7? 7*6=42, remainder 1. 43 divided by 11 is 3.909..., which is not an integer. So yes, 43 is prime.\n\n2. 4343: This is a four-digit number. Let's check if 4343 is prime. Since it's even, it's divisible by 2. So no, 4343 isn't prime. That's immediate.\n\n3. 434343: Let's see if this is prime. Let me factor it. Since it ends with 3, it isn't divisible by 2. Let's check divisibility by 3. Sum of digits: 4+3+4+3+4+3 = 21. 21 is divisible by 3, so the number is divisible by 3. Therefore, 434343 is composite.\n\n4. 43434343: Now check if this is prime. Again, let's check divisibility. Ends with 3, so not divisible by 2. Sum of digits: 4+3+4+3+4+3+4+3 = 28. 28 isn't divisible by 3, so not divisible by 3. Next, 5: Doesn't end with 0 or 5. 7? Let's try dividing by 7. Let's see: 43434343 divided by 7. 7*6000000 = 42000000. 43434343 - 42000000 = 1434343. Divide 1434343 by 7: 7*204906 = 1434342. So 1434343 - 1434342 =1. So remainder 1, so not divisible by 7. Next prime is 11. Let me check 11. The alternating sum method: (4 + 4 + 4) - (3 + 3 + 3) = (12) - (9) = 3. 3 isn't divisible by 11, so not divisible by 11. Next prime is 13. Let me try dividing 43434343 by 13. Hmm, this might take longer. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here. Let's look at the numbers with odd and even lengths.\n\nWait, let's check the numbers again. Each number has odd number of digits (2n-1). The first number is 2 digits (n=1), the second 4 digits (n=2), third 6 digits (n=3), etc. So all numbers have an odd number of digits. Numbers with an odd number of digits might have a certain structure. For example, 43 is a two-digit number, 4343 is four digits. Let me check if these have any common factors.\n\nLooking at 43 and 4343. 4343 is 43 repeated twice. So maybe 43 divides into these numbers?

The question is asking how many numbers in the list 43, 4343, 434343, ... are prime. Hmm, first, I need to understand what exactly is this sequence. Let me write down the numbers to see the pattern.\n\nThe first term is 43. Then the next term is 4343. Wait, how's that formed? 4343 is 43 followed by 43 again. So maybe each subsequent term is created by concatenating two copies of the previous term? Let me check. Starting with 43, concatenate two copies to get 4343. Then concatenate two copies of 4343 to get 43434343. So yes, each term is formed by appending the previous term to itself. So the sequence is 43, 4343, 434343, 43434343, etc. Each term is a number made up of two copies of the previous term. Interesting.\n\nNow, the problem is to check how many of these numbers are prime. I need to check each term in the sequence and determine if it's prime. Let me start by verifying the first few terms to see if any are prime and then see if a pattern emerges or if there's a prime number in the sequence, followed by composite numbers.\n\nFirst term: 43. Let me check if 43 is prime. The number 43: is it divisible by any prime number less than its square root? The square root of 43 is approximately 6.557. So primes to check are 2, 3, 5. \n\n- 43 divided by 2: 21.5, so no.\n- 43 divided by 3: 14.333..., no.\n- 43 divided by 5: 8.6, no. So 43 is prime. That's one prime number.\n\nSecond term: 4343. Let's check if this is prime. First, let's see if it's even: 4343 is odd. Sum of digits: 4 + 3 + 4 + 3 = 14, which is not divisible by 3. So 4343 is not divisible by 2 or 3. But how do we check if it's prime? Maybe using divisibility rules or factoring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can check if it's divisible by smaller primes. Let's try dividing by 7. Let me compute 4343 \u00f7 7. 7*600 = 4200. 4343 - 4200 = 143. 143 divided by 7 is 20.428..., so not divisible by 7. Next prime is 11. Let's try 11: 11*394 = 4334. 4343 - 4334 = 9. So 4343 \u00f7 11 = 394 + 9/11, so not an integer. Next, 13: 13*334 = 4342. 4343 - 4342 = 1. So not divisible by 13. Next prime is 17: Let's see 17*255 = 4335. 4343 - 4335 = 8. Not divisible by 17. Next prime is 19: 19*228 = 4332. 4343 - 4332 = 11. Not divisible by 19. Next prime is 23: 23*188 = 4324. 4343 - 4324 = 19. Not divisible by 23. Next prime is 29: 29*149 = 4321. 4343 - 4321 = 22. Not divisible by 29. Next prime is 31: 31*140 = 4340. 4343 - 4340 = 3. Not divisible by 31. So up to prime 31, 4343 is not divisible by any. Let me check 37: 37*117 = 4329. 4343 - 4329 = 14.

So each number doubles the number of 43 digits. \n\nFirst, let me check if there's a pattern or a formula here. I remember that numbers formed by repeating a certain digit pattern can sometimes be divisible by other numbers. For example, I think repunits, which are numbers consisting of all ones, can be factored if they don't follow a certain rule. Maybe something similar applies here with 43.\n\nLet me start by checking small cases:\n\n1. The first number is 43. Is 43 prime? Yes, 43 is a prime number. So that's one prime.\n\n2. The second number is 4343. Let me check if this is prime. Hmm, 4343. Let me try dividing by small primes. First, check if it's even: no, it ends with 3. So not divisible by 2. Check divisibility by 3: 4+3+4+3=14. 14 isn't divisible by 3, so not divisible by 3. Next, 5: ends with 3, so no. 7? Let me do 4343 \u00f7 7. 7*600=4200, 4343-4200=143. 143 \u00f77 is about 20.428... So not divisible by 7. How about 11? The alternating sum: (4+4)-(3+3)=8-6=2. Not divisible by 11. 13? Let me try dividing 4343 by 13. 13*300=3900, 4343-3900=443. 443 \u00f713 is approx 34.07, not an integer. 17? 17*255=4335, 4343-4335=8, not divisible by 17. 19? 19*228=4332, 4343-4332=11, not divisible by 19. 23? 23*188=4324, 4343-4324=19, not divisible by 23. So seems like 4343 is prime? Wait, but maybe I should check higher primes? Let's check 29. 29*150=4350, which is more than 4343, so 29 is too big. Maybe 31? 31*140=4340, subtract that from 4343: 4343-4340=3. So 31*140+3=4343. So not divisible by 31. 37? Let me see, 37*117=4229, 4343-4229=114. 114 \u00f737 is approx 3.108, not integer. 41? 41*106=4346, which is higher than 4343, so 4343-4346 is negative, so 41 doesn't divide it. So maybe 4343 is prime. Hmm, but let me check again. Maybe I made an error. Let me compute 4343 minus 4343 times 10? Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe use another method. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps 4343 is a prime. Let's check the square root of 4343. The square root of 4343 is approx 65.9. So I need to check primes up to 65. Let's see: primes up to 65 are 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61. We already checked up to 37 and didn't find any divisors.

Let me write out the first few terms to see if I can spot anything.\n\nThe first term is just 43. That's a prime number. Interesting. Then the next term is 4343. Let me check if that's prime. To do that, I need to see if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. Let me try dividing by smaller primes first. \n\n4343 divided by 2: It's an odd number, so not divisible by 2. Divided by 3? 4 + 3 + 4 + 3 = 14. 14 divided by 3 isn't an integer, so nope. Divided by 5? Ends with 3, so no. Divided by 7? Let me check. 4343 \u00f7 7. 7 times 600 is 4200. 4343 - 4200 = 143. 143 divided by 7 is 20 with a remainder of 3. So not divisible by 7. How about 11? The rule for 11 is alternately add and subtract the digits. Let's try that: 4 - 3 + 4 - 3 = (4 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 1 + 1 = 2. 2 isn't divisible by 11, so 11 isn't a factor. Maybe 13? Let's try 4343 \u00f7 13. 13 times 334 is 4342. Subtract that from 4343, we get 1. So remainder 1. Not a multiple of 13. Next prime is 17. 17 times 255 is 4335. 4343 - 4335 = 8. So remainder 8. Not divisible by 17. How about 19? 19 times 228 is 4332. 4343 - 4332 = 11. Not divisible by 19. 23 times 188 is 4324. 4343 - 4324 = 19. Not divisible by 23. Hmm, 29? 29 times 149 is 4321. 4343 - 4321 = 22. Not divisible by 29. 31? 31 times 140 is 4340. 4343 - 4340 = 3. Remainder 3. So not divisible by 31. Let me try 37. 37 times 117 is 4329. 4343 - 4329 = 14. 14 is not divisible by 37. Next, 41. 41 times 106 is 4346. That's more than 4343, so 4343 \u00f7 41. 41*106=4346, which is 3 more than 4343. So remainder -3, which is equivalent to 39. So 39 isn't divisible by 41. So maybe it's prime. Hmm, but wait, maybe I did the division wrong. Let me check again. 4343 divided by 41. Wait, 41*100 is 4100. 4343 - 4100 = 243. 243 divided by 41 is 5*41=205. 243-205=38. So 100 + 5 = 105, and remainder 38. So 4343 is not divisible by 41. 43 + 3 = 46, which isn't a multiple of 41. Hmm. Maybe it's prime. But I need to check higher primes. Let's check 4343 \u00f7 73.

Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the pattern of the numbers. The sequence starts with 43, then each subsequent term is formed by appending the digits \"43\" to the previous number. So the terms are:\n\n1. 43\n2. 4343\n3. 434343\n4. 43434343\n5. ...\n\nAnd so on. The first term is straightforward, which is 43. The second term is 4343, the third term is 434343, and so on, each time adding \"43\" at the end. Now, the question is asking how many of these numbers in the list are prime. \n\nI remember that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, we need to check each term of this sequence for primality.\n\nStarting with the first term, 43. Is 43 a prime number? Let me recall. 43 is only divisible by 1 and 43, so yes, it's prime. So that's one prime number.\n\nMoving on to the second term, which is 4343. Let's check if this is prime. To do this, we can test divisibility by small primes. Let's see:\n\nFirst, check if it's even; 4343 ends with 3, so it's odd. Not divisible by 2.\n\nNext, check divisibility by 3. The sum of the digits is 4 + 3 + 4 + 3 = 14, which is not divisible by 3, so 4343 is not divisible by 3.\n\nCheck divisibility by 5. Ends with 3, so no. \n\nNext, check 7. Let's divide 4343 by 7. 7 times 600 is 4200. Subtract that from 4343: 4343 - 4200 = 143. Now, 143 divided by 7 is 20.428... So not an integer. So 4343 isn't divisible by 7.\n\nHow about 11? Let's apply the divisibility rule for 11. Take the alternating sum: (4 + 4) - (3 + 3) = (8) - (6) = 2. Since 2 isn't a multiple of 11, 4343 isn't divisible by 11.\n\nCheck 13. Let's divide 4343 by 13. 13 times 300 is 3900. 4343 - 3900 = 443. 13 times 34 is 442. So 443 - 442 = 1. So remainder 1. Not divisible by 13.\n\n17: 17 times 250 is 4250. 4343 - 4250 = 93. 17 times 5 = 85. 93 - 85 = 8. Remainder 8. Not divisible.\n\n19: 19 times 200 is 3800. 4343 - 3800 = 543. 19 times 28 is 532. 543 - 532 = 11. Not divisible.\n\n23: 23 times 180 is 4140. 4343 - 4140 = 203. 23 times 8 = 184. 203 - 184 = 19. Not divisible.\n\n29: 29 times 140 is 4060. 4343 - 4060 = 283. 29 times 9 = 261. 283 - 261 = 22. Not divisible.\n\n31: 31 times 140 is 4340. 4343 - 4340 = 3. Not divisible.\n\nSo up to some point, it might not be divisible by smaller primes.

The question is: If log base 6 of (4x) equals 2, find log base x of 27. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that logarithms can be converted to exponential form. So, if log_b a = c, that's equivalent to b^c = a. Maybe I can use that here. Let me try converting both equations into exponential form. \n\nStarting with the given equation: log_6 (4x) = 2. If I convert that to exponential form, that would be 6^2 = 4x. Wait, 6 squared is 36, so 4x = 36. Then solving for x, x would be 36 divided by 4, which is 9. So x equals 9? Let me check that again. 6 to the power of 2 is indeed 36, so 4 times x is 36. If 4x = 36, then x must be 9. Okay, that seems right. \n\nNow, the problem asks to find log_x 27. Since I already found x to be 9, now I need to compute log base 9 of 27. But wait, before I proceed, maybe there's a smarter way to do this without finding x first. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using logarithmic identities and properties. Let me recall some logarithmic rules. One thing that comes to mind is the change of base formula. The change of base formula says that log_b a = (ln a)/(ln b) or (log_c a)/(log_c b) for any positive c \u2260 1. But since I already found x is 9, maybe converting both logs to base 3 or base 9 could be helpful?\n\nLet's see. Let me write down the two expressions I need to relate:\n\nlog_6 (4x) = 2 and log_x 27 = ?. \n\nSince x is 9, log_9 27 is equivalent to log base 9 of 27. Let me compute that directly. What's 9's logarithm base 9 of 27? Well, 9 is 3 squared, and 27 is 3 cubed. So, 9^k = 27. Let's solve for k. \n\n10^k = 27/9 = 3. So, 3^k = 3^1. Therefore, k = 1. So log_9 27 is 1. Wait, but let me verify that again. \n\nAlternatively, using logarithmic identities. Let's express log_x 27. Let me write log_x 27 as log_9 27. Then, using change of base formula, log_9 27 = (log_3 27)/(log_3 9). Because log_b a = log_c a / log_c b. So here, base 9, so change of base to base 3. \n\nCompute numerator: log_3 27. Since 3^3 = 27, so log_3 27 = 3. \n\nDenominator: log_3 9. Since 3^2 = 9, so log_3 9 = 2. \n\nTherefore, log_9 27 = 3 / 2. \n\nSo that gives me 3/2. So the answer is 3/2. Let me check that again step by step.\n\nFirst, given log_6 (4x) = 2. Convert that to exponential form: 6^2 = 4x. Which is 36 = 4x, so x=9. Correct.\n\nThen, log_x 27. Since x is 9, log_9 27. Express as log base 9 of 27. Use change of base to base 3: log_9 27 = log_3 27 / log_3 9. \n\nlog_3 27 is 3, log_3 9 is 2. So 3/2. Yes, that's 1.5, which is 3/2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe use logarithm identities without converting to base 3. Let's see. \n\nlog_x 27. If I express log_x 27 as (log 27)/(log x). So perhaps write that in terms of natural logs: (ln 27)/(ln x). But since x = 9, ln x = ln 9. So that would be (ln 27)/(ln 9).

Hmm, let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, let me parse the given equation. The problem states that log\u2086(4x) = 2. I need to find log\u209327. I remember that logarithms can be converted to exponential form. Maybe that will help here. Let me recall the relationship between logarithmic and exponential equations. If log_b(a) = c, then b^c = a. So applying that here, starting with log\u2086(4x) = 2, this should mean 6^2 = 4x. Let me check that. Yes, 6 squared is 36, so 4x equals 36. Then, solving for x, divide both sides by 4: x = 36/4 = 9. So x is 9. \n\nWait, let me verify that. If I accept x = 9, then substitute back into the original equation to check if log\u2086(4x) equals 2. So 4x is 4*9 = 36. So log base 6 of 36 should be 2. Let me check: 6 to the power of 2 is 36. Yes, exactly. So x is indeed 9. \n\nNow, the question is to find log\u209327. Since x is 9, we need to find log base 9 of 27. Let me think about how to compute that. I recall that logarithms can be expressed in terms of change of base formula if needed, but maybe there's a way to simplify this without converting to logarithms. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe express both numbers as powers of 3. Let's see: 9 is 3 squared, and 27 is 3 cubed. So log base 3^2 (which is 9) of 3^3. Using logarithm properties, log_b(a^c) = c*log_b(a). So that would be 3*log\u2083(3). Since log base 3 of 3 is 1, this simplifies to 3*1 = 3. Therefore, log\u209327 is 3. \n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check using another method to be sure. Let me verify the steps again. \n\nGiven log\u2086(4x) = 2. Converting to exponential: 6^2 = 4x. So 36 = 4x. Then x = 36/4 = 9. Correct. Then log\u208927. Let's write 27 as 9*3. So log\u2089(9*3) = log\u20899 + log\u20893. But log\u20899 is 1, since 9^1 = 9. So that's 1 + log\u20893. Now, log\u20893 = log\u20833 / log\u20839 (Change of base formula). Since log\u20839 is 2, because 3^2 = 9. Therefore, log\u20893 = 1/2. So putting it all together: 1 + 1/2 = 3/2. Wait, but this contradicts the previous answer. Hmm, so there's a mistake somewhere. Let me trace back.\n\nWait, log\u208927 is 3. According to the previous method, breaking down the log: log\u208927 = log\u2089(9*3) = log\u20899 + log\u20893 = 1 + log\u20893. But log\u20893 is equal to log\u20833 / log\u20839, which is 1 / 2. So adding those gives 1 + 1/2 = 3/2. But 3/2 is 1.5, but the answer I got earlier was 3. So that's different. Therefore, there's an inconsistency here. So I must have made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me check again.\n\nStarting over: log\u2086(4x) = 2. So 6^2 = 4x => 36 = 4x => x = 9. Correct. Then log\u208727 (wait, hold on, x is 9, so log_x27 is log_9 27. Which we calculated as 3. But according to this, 3 is different from 3/2. So clearly, my second method is wrong. What's the error here?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake in the second method. Let me recalculate.

So, we have the equation log base 6 of (4x) equals 2, and we need to find log base x of 27. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. \n\nFirst, I remember that log_b a = c can be rewritten in exponential form as b^c = a. That might be useful here. Let me apply that to the first equation. The given equation is log_6 (4x) = 2. Converting that to exponential form, it should be 6^2 = 4x. Let me check that. If log_6 (4x) = 2, then 6 squared is indeed 4x. So, 36 = 4x. Then, dividing both sides by 4 gives x = 36 / 4 = 9. Wait, x is 9. Is that right? Let me verify. If x is 9, then log_6 (4*9) = log_6 (36). And 6 squared is 36, so that would be 2. Yep, that checks out. So x is 9.\n\nOkay, now we need to find log base x of 27. Since we found x to be 9, this becomes log_9 27. Hmm, how do I compute this? Let me think. There are a couple of ways to approach this. One way is to remember that logarithms can be converted using change of base formula. The change of base formula says that log_b a = (ln a)/(ln b) or log_b a = (log_c a)/(log_c b) for any positive number c. Alternatively, we can express 27 as a power of 9 because 27 is 3 cubed, and 3 is 9 raised to 1/2. Let me try that.\n\nSince 27 = 3^3, and 3 = 9^(1/2), so 3^3 = (9^(1/2))^3 = 9^(3/2). Therefore, log_9 27 = log_9 (9^(3/2)) = 3/2. Because log base b of b^k is just k. So, 3/2. Let me check if this is correct. If log base 9 of 27 is 3/2, then 9^(3/2) should be 27. Let's compute 9^(3/2). 9^(1/2) is 3, so 9^(3/2) is 3 squared, which is 9. Wait, that's not 27. Hmm, so there's a mistake here. What did I do wrong?\n\nOh, I think I misapplied the exponents. 27 is 3^3, which is (9^(1/2))^3, so that's 9^(3/2). But 9^(3/2) is indeed (3^2)^(3/2) = 3^(3) = 27. So, log_9 27 = 3/2 is actually correct. That makes sense. So, even though 9^(3/2) is 27, log base 9 of 27 is 3/2. Therefore, the answer is 3/2. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. 9^(1/2) is 3, so 3 squared is 9. Then 9^(3/2) is 9^(3)^(1/2) = 729^(1/2) = 27. So, yes, exponent laws apply here. Therefore, log_9 27 is indeed 3/2. Therefore, the answer is 3/2.\n\nBut let me just confirm with another method to be thorough. Another approach is to express 27 as 3^3 and 9 as 3^2, so log base 3^2 of 3^3. Then, using logarithmic properties. The formula is log_{b^k} (b^m) = m/k. So, log base 9 (27) is log_{3^2} (3^3) = 3/2. That's the same result. Therefore, this confirms it. So, the answer should be 3/2.\n\nWait, but just to ensure that x is indeed 9, I should double-check the first step. The problem states to find log_x 27 given that log_6 (4x) = 2. So, log base 6 of (4x) equals 2, which led us to x = 9.

Wait, log base 9 of 27. Let me recall logarithm properties to solve this. Maybe express both bases as powers of smaller exponents. For example, 9 is 3\u00b2 and 27 is 3\u00b3. So, log\u2083\u00b2(3\u00b3). Using the change of base formula, which is log_b(a) = log_c(a)/log_c(b). Maybe using base 3 here? Let's try:\n\nlog\u2089(27) = log\u2083(27)/log\u2083(9) = (3)/2 = 3/2. So, log base 9 of 27 is 3/2. Wait, is that right? Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe convert the logarithm to another base. Using natural logarithm: ln(27)/ln(9). Since ln(27) is ln(3\u00b3) = 3 ln3, and ln(9) is ln(3\u00b2) = 2 ln3. So, dividing them gives (3 ln3)/(2 ln3) = 3/2. Yep, same result. That confirms it. So, log base 9 of 27 is indeed 3/2.\n\nBut let me just make sure there's no catch here. The problem didn't specify any constraints on x, like x being a prime or something. Since x came out as 9, which is 3 squared, that's okay. So, all steps are valid.\n\nWait, just to recap:\n\n1. Given log\u2086(4x) = 2. Convert to exponential: 6\u00b2 = 4x => x=9.\n2. Find log\u2089(27). Express 9 as 3\u00b2 and 27 as 3\u00b3. Therefore, log\u2083\u00b2(3\u00b3) = 3/2. Either using the change of base formula with base 3 or directly using natural logs also gives 3/2.\n\nSo, I think that's all. The answer should be 3/2. Let me check once more with another method. Maybe expressing log\u2086(4x) = 2. So 6\u00b2 = 4x. Then x = 36/4 = 9. Then, log base 9 of 27. Since 27 is 9^(3/2), because 9^(1/2) is 3, so squared it's 9, cubed is 27. Therefore, log\u2089(27) = 3/2. Yeah, that makes sense. So, all approaches lead to 3/2.

The problem says: If log base 6 of (4x) is 2, find log base x of 27. Hmm, I need to find the value of log_x 27 given that log_6(4x) = 2. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let me recall the definition of a logarithm. The logarithm log_b(a) = c means that b^c = a. So, applying that here, log_6(4x) = 2 translates to 6^2 = 4x. Let me write that down:\n\n6^2 = 4x.\n\nCalculating 6 squared: 6*6 = 36, so:\n\n36 = 4x.\n\nNow, solving for x: divide both sides by 4. So, 36 / 4 = x. Let me compute that: 36 divided by 4 is 9. Therefore, x = 9.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me verify. If x is 9, then log base 9 of 27. Let me check if that's correct. Wait, but let me go back through the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nOriginal equation: log_6(4x) = 2. Convert that to exponential form. So 6^2 = 4x. 6 squared is 36, so 4x = 36. Then x = 36 / 4 = 9. Okay, that checks out. So x is 9.\n\nNow, the second part is log_x 27. Since x is 9, we need to find log base 9 of 27. Wait, let me confirm that. Let me write that down:\n\nlog_x 27 = log_9 27.\n\nHmm, how do I compute this? Let me recall that logarithms can be converted using different bases. Maybe using change of base formula. Alternatively, maybe expressing 27 and 9 in terms of powers of 3, since 9 is 3^2 and 27 is 3^3.\n\nYes, 27 is 3^3 and 9 is 3^2. So log_9 27 is log_{3^2} 3^3. Using the logarithm power rule, log_{a^b} a^c = c/b. So here, it would be 3/2. Let me verify that.\n\nAlternatively, using the definition of logarithms. If I let y = log_9 27, then 9^y = 27. Since 9 is 3^2 and 27 is 3^3, then (3^2)^y = 3^3. That simplifies to 3^{2y} = 3^3. Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal: 2y = 3 => y = 3/2. So that's another way to see it.\n\nTherefore, log_9 27 = 3/2. So the answer should be 3/2. Let me check if this makes sense.\n\nLet me verify if log_6(4x) = 2 when x is 9. 4x when x=9 is 4*9=36, and log_6(36). But 6 squared is 36, so log_6(36) is indeed 2. That checks out.\n\nAlso, 27 is 3^3 and 9 is 3^2. So 27 divided by 9 is 3, which is 3^1. So 27 is 9 times 3, which is 9^(1) * 9^(log_9 3) = 9^{1 + 1/2} = 9^{3/2}, which is 27. So that's consistent with log_9 27 being 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 3/2.

The problem is: If log base 6 of (4x) equals 2, find log base x of 27. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the problem gives me an equation: log\u2086(4x) = 2. I need to find log\u2093(27). Let me recall the properties of logarithms. Remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So, maybe I can use that to rewrite the original equation and then relate it to the desired logarithm.\n\nStarting with the given equation: log\u2086(4x) = 2. Using the definition of logarithms, this means that 6^2 = 4x. Let me write that out:\n\n6\u00b2 = 4x\n\nCalculating 6 squared: 6*6 = 36, so:\n\n36 = 4x\n\nNow, solve for x. Divide both sides by 4:\n\nx = 36 / 4 = 9\n\nSo x is 9. Now that I know x, I need to find log\u2093(27). Since x is 9, this becomes log\u2089(27). Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, 9 is 3\u00b2 and 27 is 3\u00b3. So, expressing both numbers in terms of base 3:\n\nlog\u2089(27) = log_{3\u00b2}(3\u00b3)\n\nUsing the logarithm power rule, which states that log_{a^b}(c^d) = (d/b) * log_a(c). Since log_a(a) = 1, this simplifies to (d/b). Wait, let me verify that step.\n\nAlternatively, log_{a^b}(c^d) can be rewritten as (d / b) * log_a(c). Let me check with an example. Suppose we have log_{8}(64). Since 8 is 2\u00b3 and 64 is 2\u2076, log\u2082(64) = 6. Using the formula, log_{2\u00b3}(2\u2076) = (6 / 3) * log\u2082(2) = 2 * 1 = 2, which matches. So the formula works here.\n\nSo applying the formula here, log\u2089(27) = (3 / 2) * log\u2083(3). Since log\u2083(3) = 1, this simplifies to 3/2. Therefore, log\u2093(27) is 3/2.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Alternatively, if x is 9 and 27 is 9^(3/2), because 9^(1/2) is 3, and 9^(3/2) = 3*3*3 = 27. So, log\u2089(27) = log\u2089(9^(3/2)) = 3/2. Yep, that makes sense. So the answer is 3/2. Let me check once again.\n\nOriginal equation: log\u2086(4x) = 2. x is 9, so 4x = 36, and log\u2086(36) = 2. Which is correct because 6\u00b2 = 36. Then, log\u2093(27) becomes log\u2089(27) which is indeed 3/2. So yes, the answer is 3/2.\n\nI think that's it. All steps check out. Just to recap:\n\n1. Convert the logarithmic equation to exponential form to solve for x.\n2. Substitute the value of x into the desired logarithm.\n3. Simplify using logarithm properties to find the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could have approached it by expressing both logarithms with the same base or using change of base formula to see if it leads to the same result. Let me try that method to verify.\n\nUsing change of base formula: log\u2093(27) = log\u2086(27) / log\u2086(x)\n\nWe already know log\u2086(27). Let's compute that. 27 is 3\u00b3, so log\u2086(3\u00b3) = 3 log\u2086(3)\n\nSimilarly, log\u2086(x) = log\u2086(9) = log\u2086(3\u00b2) = 2 log\u2086(3)\n\nTherefore, log\u2093(27) = [3 log\u2086(3)] / [2 log\u2086(3)] = 3/2\n\nSame result! So that confirms the answer is 3/2.

Let me start by recalling some logarithmic identities. \n\nFirst, the given equation is log\u2086(4x) = 2. Since logarithms are exponents, I can convert this to exponential form. Let me do that. \n\nSo, 6\u00b2 = 4x. Let me write that down:\n\n6\u00b2 = 36 = 4x.\n\nWait, solving for x: 36 divided by 4 is 9. So x = 9. Right? Let me check: 4x = 4*9 = 36, and log base 6 of 36 is 2 because 6\u00b2 is 36. Yep, that checks out. So x is 9. Okay, so maybe I can use this x value into the log_x 27. Since x is 9, we need to compute log base 9 of 27.\n\nOkay, log base 9 of 27. Let's see. Let me recall that log_b a = c means b^c = a. So, log\u2089(27) = c implies 9^c = 27. \n\nWhat's 9 to the power of what gives 27? Well, 9 is 3\u00b2, and 27 is 3\u00b3. So maybe rewrite 9 as 3\u00b2. Then 9^c = (3\u00b2)^c = 3^(2c). And 27 is 3\u00b3. So 3^(2c) = 3\u00b3. Therefore, 2c = 3, so c = 3/2. \n\nWait, is that right? Let me verify. If c is 3/2, then 9^(3/2) is (3\u00b2)^(3/2) = 3^(2*(3/2)) = 3\u00b3 = 27. Yes, that works. So log base 9 of 27 is 3/2. Therefore, the answer should be 3/2. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps. Let me check the initial equation again. If log base 6 of 4x is 2, then 6^2 = 4x => 36 = 4x => x = 9. Correct. So x is indeed 9. Then log base 9 of 27. Since 27 is 3^3 and 9 is 3^2, then 3^(2c) = 3\u00b3 => 2c = 3 => c = 3/2. So log base 9 of 27 is 3/2. \n\nAlternatively, using logarithm properties. Let's see. Since the answer is 3/2, maybe I can use change of base formula to verify. \n\nlog\u2089(27) = log(27)/log(9) base 6, but wait, the original problem uses log base 6. So maybe better to use natural log for verification. Let's compute:\n\nln(27)/ln(9) = (ln 3^3)/(ln 3^2) = (3 ln 3)/(2 ln 3) = 3/2. \n\nYes, that's the same result. So that confirms it. Therefore, the answer is 3/2. \n\nJust to recap, the given equation gives x = 9. Then log base x of 27 is log base 9 of 27, which is 3/2. So the answer is 3/2. \n\nI think that's solid. I didn't make any mistakes in the reasoning.

Hmm, let's see. First, I remember that solving quadratic inequalities involves finding the critical points where the quadratic expression equals zero and then testing the intervals between those points to see where the inequality holds true. The quadratic here is in the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\), where \\(a = -12\\), \\(b = 3\\), and \\(c = -5\\). Since the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) is negative, the parabola opens downward. That means the parabola will have a maximum point, and the inequality \\(-12x^2 + 3x - 5 < 0\\) will hold true outside the interval between the roots of the equation \\(-12x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0\\). \n\nSo, the first step is to find the roots of the equation. I need to solve \\(-12x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0\\). Let me write that equation down again: \\(-12x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0\\). To solve this, I can use the quadratic formula, which is \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\). Plugging in the values:\n\nHere, \\(a = -12\\), \\(b = 3\\), \\(c = -5\\). Let's substitute these into the formula.\n\nFirst, compute the discriminant, \\(D = b^2 - 4ac = (3)^2 - 4*(-12)*(-5)\\). Let's calculate that step by step.\n\n\\(D = 9 - 4*(-12)*(-5)\\). Wait, hold on, \\(4*a*c\\) would be 4*(-12)*(-5). Let me check that again. The discriminant is \\(b^2 - 4ac\\). So, \\(4ac\\) is 4*(-12)*(-5). Let me compute each term:\n\nFirst, \\(4ac = 4*(-12)*(-5) = 4*60 = 240\\). So, the discriminant is 9 - 240 = -231. \n\nWait, that's negative discriminant. Hmm, that seems problematic. Let me verify my calculation again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nGiven \\(a = -12\\), \\(b = 3\\), \\(c = -5\\):\n\n\\(4ac = 4*(-12)*(-5)\\). Multiplying the numbers: 4*12=48, then times 5 is 240. So yes, 4ac=240. Then the discriminant is \\(b^2 - 4ac = 9 - 240 = -231\\). So, indeed, the discriminant is negative. \n\nSince the discriminant is negative, the quadratic equation has no real roots. Therefore, the parabola doesn't cross the x-axis. But since the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) is negative, the parabola opens downward. That means the entire quadratic is always negative. Wait, is that possible? Let me think. If the parabola opens downward and it has no real roots, then it stays below the x-axis for all real x. So, the expression \\(-12x^2 + 3x - 5\\) is always less than zero for all real x. Therefore, the inequality \\(-12x^2 + 3x - 5 < 0\\) is true for all real numbers x? \n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. If the discriminant is negative, the parabola doesn't touch or cross the x-axis. Since it opens downward, it must be entirely below the x-axis. Therefore, the inequality holds for all real x. So, the solution is all real numbers. \n\nBut let me double-check my discriminant calculation to ensure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nQuadratic equation: ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0.

Hmm, let me think step by step. First, I remember that quadratic inequalities can often be solved by finding the roots of the quadratic equation and then determining the intervals where the inequality holds. Let me start by converting the given inequality into a quadratic equation to find its roots.\n\nThe equation will be -12x\u00b2 + 3x - 5 = 0. Since the coefficients are integers, maybe I can apply the quadratic formula here. The quadratic formula is x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / (2a). Let's identify a, b, and c for this equation.\n\nHere, a = -12, b = 3, and c = -5. Plugging these into the formula:\n\nx = [ -3 \u00b1 \u221a(3\u00b2 - 4*(-12)*(-5)) ] / (2*(-12))\n\nLet me compute the discriminant first. The discriminant is D = b\u00b2 - 4ac.\n\nCalculating D: 3\u00b2 is 9. Then 4ac is 4*(-12)*(-5). Let's compute that: 4*12*5 = 240. So D = 9 - 240 = -231.\n\nWait, the discriminant is -231, which is negative. Hmm, that means the quadratic equation has no real roots. Since the coefficient of x\u00b2 is negative (-12), the parabola opens downward. That makes sense because when a quadratic opens downward and has a negative discriminant, the entire parabola is below the x-axis, meaning the inequality is always satisfied for all real x. Let me verify that.\n\nIf the quadratic opens downward and has no real roots, then the entire graph is below the x-axis. Therefore, the inequality -12x\u00b2 + 3x - 5 < 0 is true for all real numbers x. Is that right? Let me check with some test values.\n\nTake x = 0: -12*(0)^2 + 3*(0) -5 = -5 < 0. That's true.\n\nTake x = 1: -12 + 3 -5 = -14 < 0. Also true.\n\nTake x approaching infinity: -12x\u00b2 dominates, which is negative infinity. So, yes, as x approaches positive or negative infinity, the expression tends to negative infinity. So, since the parabola is always below the x-axis, the inequality holds for all x. That seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should go through the steps again. Let's do the quadratic formula step by step.\n\nQuadratic formula: x = [ -3 \u00b1 \u221a(9 - 4*(-12)*(-5)) ] / (2*(-12))\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n9 - 4*(-12)*(-5) = 9 - 4*12*5 = 9 - 240 = -231. Yep, same result. So square root of negative 231 is imaginary. So roots are complex: x = [ -3 \u00b1 i\u221a231 ] / (-24). Wait, but even complex roots don't affect the solution set for a real inequality. Since the problem is about real numbers, complex roots are irrelevant here. Therefore, there are no real solutions, so the inequality holds for all real x.\n\nTherefore, the solution is all real numbers. So the answer is x \u2208 \u211d.\n\nBut let me double-check in case I made a mistake. Maybe the problem was miswritten? The original inequality was written as -12x\u00b2 + 3x - 5 < 0. Is that correct? The coefficient of x is 3, the constant term is -5, and the leading coefficient is -12. Yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor the quadratic, even though there are no real roots. Let's see:\n\nIf the discriminant is negative, the quadratic doesn't factor over the reals. So factoring isn't helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe completing the square?

Let me think about how to approach this step by step. First, it's a quadratic inequality, right? The quadratic is -12x\u00b2 + 3x - 5. The standard form for a quadratic equation is ax\u00b2 + bx + c, so here a is -12, b is 3, and c is -5. \n\nSince the coefficient of x\u00b2 is negative (-12), the parabola opens downward. That usually means the quadratic expression is positive outside the roots and negative between the roots. But let me check that. If the coefficient was positive, it would open upwards, so positive outside the roots. But since it's negative here, it's the reverse. So the parabola opens downward, so it's negative between the roots and positive outside.\n\nBut before I get too bogged down, let me confirm the leading coefficient. Yes, it's -12, so it's opening downward. Therefore, the inequality -12x\u00b2 + 3x -5 < 0 will be true between the roots of the equation -12x\u00b2 + 3x -5 = 0. So I need to find the roots first and then determine the intervals where the inequality holds.\n\nTo find the roots, I'll use the quadratic formula: x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)]/(2a). Plugging in the values, a is -12, b is 3, and c is -5. Let me compute the discriminant first because that might be important.\n\nDiscriminant D = b\u00b2 - 4ac = (3)\u00b2 - 4*(-12)*(-5) = 9 - 4*(12)*(5). Wait, hold on, 4*(-12)*(-5) is 4*12*5, which is 240. So D = 9 - 240 = -231. Hmm, the discriminant is negative. That means the quadratic equation has no real roots. Wait, but that can't be right. If there's no real root, then the quadratic expression doesn't cross the x-axis. But since the parabola opens downward, it will be always negative. So the inequality -12x\u00b2 + 3x -5 < 0 is true for all real numbers x. Is that possible?\n\nWait, let me check my discriminant again. Originally, the quadratic is -12x\u00b2 + 3x -5. So comparing to standard form, a = -12, b = 3, c = -5. Then discriminant D = b\u00b2 - 4ac. Substituting, that's 3\u00b2 - 4*(-12)*(-5). Which is 9 - 4*12*5. Let me compute 4*12 first: 48, then 48*5 = 240. So 9 - 240 = -231. Yes, that's correct. So the discriminant is indeed negative, so there are no real roots. Therefore, the quadratic never touches the x-axis and since it opens downward, it's always below the x-axis. Therefore, the inequality -12x\u00b2 + 3x -5 < 0 is true for all real numbers x.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. If I plug in x = 0 into the quadratic, I get -5, which is less than 0. What about x = 1? Plugging into the quadratic: -12(1)\u00b2 + 3(1) -5 = -12 + 3 -5 = -14 < 0. x = 2: -12(4) + 6 -5 = -48 + 1 = -47 < 0. x = 10: -12(100) + 30 -5 = -1200 + 25 = -1175 < 0. So every time I pick a real number, the value of the quadratic is negative. Since it never crosses the x-axis, it never becomes positive. Thus, the inequality holds for all real numbers x.\n\nTherefore, the solution set is all real numbers, which in interval notation is (-\u221e, \u221e).

Let's plug in the values a = -12, b = 3, c = -5.\n\nCalculating the discriminant first: D = b\u00b2 - 4ac = (3)\u00b2 - 4*(-12)*(-5) = 9 - 4*12*5 = 9 - 240 = -231. Wait, the discriminant is negative. That means the quadratic equation has no real roots. Interesting. So the parabola doesn't cross the x-axis. Since the leading coefficient is negative, which is -12, the parabola opens downward. So that tells me that the quadratic expression is always negative where the parabola is below the x-axis. But since it doesn't cross the x-axis, maybe the entire parabola is below the x-axis? Let me check. If the parabola opens downward and has no real roots, then the entire graph is below the x-axis. That means the inequality -12x\u00b2 +3x -5 <0 is true for all real numbers x. Wait, is that right? Let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in computing the discriminant. Let me check again:\n\nD = b\u00b2 - 4ac = 3\u00b2 - 4*(-12)*(-5) = 9 - 4*12*5. Wait, 4*12 is 48, and 48*5 is 240. So 9 - 240 = -231. Yes, correct. So discriminant is negative. Therefore, quadratic has no real roots. Since the parabola opens downward, it's always below the x-axis. Therefore, the inequality -12x\u00b2 +3x -5 <0 is true for all real numbers x. So the solution is all real numbers, or in interval notation, (-\u221e, \u221e).\n\nBut wait, to be thorough, let me try another method. Maybe completing the square. Let's see. The quadratic is -12x\u00b2 +3x -5. Let me factor out the leading coefficient first. Wait, but since it's a quadratic, factoring might not be straightforward here. Alternatively, maybe I can multiply both sides by -1 to make it easier, but I have to be careful when multiplying inequalities. If I multiply both sides by -1, the inequality direction reverses. Let me try that:\n\n-12x\u00b2 +3x -5 < 0\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 (which reverses the inequality):\n\n12x\u00b2 -3x +5 > 0\n\nNow, the new quadratic is 12x\u00b2 -3x +5. Let me check if this quadratic ever equals zero. Compute the discriminant here: D = (-3)\u00b2 -4*12*5 = 9 - 240 = -231. Again, discriminant is negative. So, this quadratic opens upward (since the coefficient of x\u00b2 is positive), and it has no real roots. Therefore, it is always positive. So the inequality 12x\u00b2 -3x +5 >0 is true for all real numbers x. Therefore, the original inequality -12x\u00b2 +3x -5 <0 is equivalent to 12x\u00b2 -3x +5 >0, which is true for all x. Hence, the solution is indeed all real numbers.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the solution to the inequality is all real numbers. Therefore, in interval notation, (-\u221e, \u221e). Since I couldn't find any restrictions or values that would make the inequality false, that seems right.\n\nI think that's it. Let me check once again. If I plug in any x, say x=0: -12*(0)^2 +3*(0) -5 = -5 <0. True.

Hmm, transcendental equation? Wait, no, it's a quadratic inequality, right? Because the highest power of x is 2. So maybe I can start by treating this as a quadratic equation and then figuring out where the inequality holds. \n\nFirst, I remember that for quadratic inequalities, the approach is to find the roots of the quadratic equation and then determine the intervals where the quadratic is positive or negative. But since the coefficient of x\u00b2 is negative here (-12), the parabola opens downward. That means the graph faces downward, and the quadratic will be below zero (negative) outside the roots. Wait, but let me confirm that.\n\nIf the quadratic opens downward (because the coefficient of x\u00b2 is negative), then the parabola will cross the x-axis at two points (if there are real roots). The inequality will be less than zero between the roots and greater than zero outside. However, since the coefficient is negative, when moving towards negative infinity, the quadratic is positive (since as x approaches negative infinity, the x\u00b2 term dominates and since the coefficient is negative, it goes to negative infinity, but wait, no. If the coefficient is negative, then as x approaches negative infinity, the leading term is -12x\u00b2, which will go to negative infinity. So, the parabola goes to negative infinity as x approaches negative infinity and positive infinity as x approaches positive infinity. But since it opens downward, the graph will have a maximum point.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If the coefficient is negative, the parabola opens downward, so as x approaches both positive and negative infinity, the function tends to negative infinity. So the maximum point is the highest point, and the graph decreases on both ends. So, if there are two real roots, the quadratic will be positive between the roots and negative outside. But since the coefficient of x\u00b2 is negative, the entire quadratic is positive between the roots and negative outside. Wait, no, that can't be. If the parabola opens downward, then it's positive between the roots and negative outside. So, yes, the inequality -12x\u00b2 + 3x -5 <0 will hold between the two roots. But I need to make sure I find the roots first.\n\nSo, let's write the quadratic equation: -12x\u00b2 + 3x -5 = 0. Let me rearrange it for clarity: 12x\u00b2 -3x +5 = 0. Wait, changing the signs. Because if we multiply both sides by -1, we get 12x\u00b2 -3x +5 = 0. So that's correct. Now, to find the roots, we can use the quadratic formula: x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a). Here, a =12, b=-3, c=5. Let's compute the discriminant first: D = (-3)\u00b2 -4*12*5 = 9 -240 = -231. Wait, that's negative. So, discriminant is negative, which means there are no real roots. So, the quadratic doesn't cross the x-axis. Since the parabola opens downward and the coefficient is negative, then the entire parabola is either always negative or always positive. But since the lead coefficient (a=12) is positive, the parabola opens upwards, but after flipping the equation to multiply by -1, it opens downward. So, if there are no real roots, the quadratic is always negative. Wait, but hold on. If discriminant is negative, then no real roots, so the quadratic is always positive or always negative. Since the coefficient of x\u00b2 is negative, as x approaches negative infinity, the quadratic tends to positive infinity, and as x approaches positive infinity, it tends to negative infinity. So, it must be negative somewhere. But no real roots, meaning it's always negative. Wait, but that can't be. Wait, maybe if I graph it, but maybe not. Let me confirm.\n\nWait, discriminant is D = b\u00b2 -4ac = (-3)^2 -4*12*5 = 9 -240 = -231. Negative discriminant. So the quadratic 12x\u00b2 -3x +5 can never cross the x-axis. So, since the coefficient of x\u00b2 is positive (12), the parabola opens upwards. Then, after flipping the equation, the quadratic -12x\u00b2 +3x -5 is equivalent to -(12x\u00b2 -3x +5) which is -[positive], so the entire left side is negative. So, the entire quadratic is always negative. But hold on, maybe not.

Hmm, quadratic inequality. Alright, step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that with quadratic inequalities, I should first find the roots of the corresponding quadratic equation. The roots will help me determine where the quadratic expression is positive or negative. Since the inequality is less than zero, I need to find where the quadratic is below the x-axis, which will open upwards if the coefficient of x\u00b2 is positive. Wait, but here the coefficient is -12, which is negative. So the parabola opens downward. That might make things a bit tricky. Let me check that.\n\nThe quadratic equation is -12x\u00b2 + 3x - 5 = 0. To find the roots, I can use the quadratic formula. The formula is x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / (2a). Here, a = -12, b = 3, and c = -5. Let me compute the discriminant first.\n\nDiscriminant D = b\u00b2 - 4ac = (3)\u00b2 - 4*(-12)*(-5) = 9 - 4*12*5. Wait, 4*12 is 48, and 48*5 is 240. So D = 9 - 240 = -231. Hmm, the discriminant is negative. That means the quadratic has no real roots. Interesting. So the quadratic never touches the x-axis. Since the coefficient of x\u00b2 is negative, the parabola opens downward. That would mean the entire graph is below the x-axis, right? Wait, if the parabola opens downward and has no x-intercepts, then the quadratic is always negative. So that would mean the inequality -12x\u00b2 + 3x - 5 < 0 is true for all real numbers x.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the discriminant. Let me check again.\n\na = -12, b = 3, c = -5. So D = 3\u00b2 - 4*(-12)*(-5) = 9 - 4*12*5. The product of 4 and 12 is 48, and 48*5 is 240. So 9 - 240 is indeed -231. Okay, so D is negative. So since the parabola opens downward and there are no real roots, the entire graph is below the x-axis. Therefore, the inequality is true for all real x.\n\nSo the solution set is all real numbers. Therefore, the answer is (-\u221e, \u221e) or in box notation, \\boxed{(-\\infty, \\infty)}.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. The inequality is -12x\u00b2 + 3x - 5 < 0. Since the quadratic opens downward and is always negative, the inequality is satisfied everywhere. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should verify by plugging in a point. Let's pick x = 0. Plugging into the quadratic: -12(0)\u00b2 + 3(0) -5 = -5. Which is indeed less than 0. Another point, x = 1: -12(1)\u00b2 + 3(1) -5 = -12 + 3 -5 = -14, which is still less than 0. x = 2: -12(4) + 6 -5 = -48 + 1 = -47, still negative. How about x = 10: -12(100) + 30 -5 = -1200 + 25 = -1175, definitely less than 0. So it seems the quadratic is always negative, so the inequality holds for all real x.\n\nTherefore, the answer is all real numbers. I think that's correct.

Hmm, let's see. I remember that to solve quadratic inequalities, I can first find the roots of the quadratic equation -12x\u00b2 + 3x - 5 = 0 because the inequality changes sign at those points. Then, I can test the intervals between those roots to see where the inequality holds true.\n\nFirst, let me write down the quadratic equation:\n\n-12x\u00b2 + 3x - 5 = 0\n\nHmm, usually I start by rearranging the terms, but it's already in standard form: ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0. So here, a is -12, b is 3, and c is -5. Let me check if I can multiply both sides by -1 to make the coefficient of x\u00b2 positive, which might make factoring easier. So that would give:\n\n12x\u00b2 - 3x + 5 = 0\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to use the quadratic formula in a way that keeps the original coefficients. Let me just apply the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / (2a). So plugging in the values:\n\na = -12, b = 3, c = -5\n\nSo discriminant D = b\u00b2 - 4ac = (3)\u00b2 - 4*(-12)*(-5) = 9 - 4*12*5 = 9 - 240 = -231\n\nOh, the discriminant is negative. That means the quadratic equation has no real roots. So the parabola doesn't cross the x-axis. But wait, the coefficient of x\u00b2 is -12, which is negative. So the parabola opens downward. Which means that the entire parabola is below the x-axis, so the quadratic expression is always negative.\n\nBut here's the problem. The inequality is -12x\u00b2 + 3x - 5 < 0. Since the parabola opens downward, is the entire expression always negative? Let me verify that. If the parabola opens downward and there are no real roots, then the expression is always below the x-axis. So that means the inequality holds for all real numbers x. Therefore, the solution is all real numbers: (-\u221e, \u221e).\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the discriminant. Let me recalculate the discriminant step by step.\n\nDiscriminant D = b\u00b2 - 4ac = (3)\u00b2 - 4*(-12)*(-5). Let's compute each part:\n\n3\u00b2 = 9\n\n4*12*5 = 48*5 = 240\n\nSo D = 9 - 240 = -231. Yes, that's correct. So discriminant is negative, which means no real roots. Since the coefficient of x\u00b2 is negative, the parabola opens downward. Therefore, the expression is always below the x-axis, so inequality is always true. Therefore, the solution is all real numbers.\n\nBut let me think again to avoid a common mistake. Suppose I had a positive coefficient for x\u00b2, then if the discriminant is negative, the parabola is always positive, so the inequality would hold wherever the quadratic is positive. But here, the coefficient is negative, so it's always negative. So yes, the solution is all real numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider multiplying both sides by -1 and flipping the inequality sign. Let me try that approach to check.\n\nOriginal inequality: -12x\u00b2 + 3x -5 < 0\n\nMultiply both sides by -1: 12x\u00b2 -3x +5 > 0\n\nNow, the quadratic 12x\u00b2 -3x +5 is a parabola opening upwards (coefficient of x\u00b2 is positive). Let's check its discriminant:\n\nD' = (-3)^2 - 4*12*5 = 9 - 240 = -231, same as before. Since discriminant is negative, the quadratic is always positive.

The problem says there are two concentric circles, which means they share the same center. The radii are 19 and 29 units. So the shaded region is the area between the two circles, right? And we need to find the radius of a third circle whose area is equal to that of the shaded region. Hmm. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the area of a circle is given by the formula A = \u03c0r\u00b2. So, the area of each circle can be calculated by plugging in the radius into this formula. But since the shaded region is between the two concentric circles, do we subtract the area of the smaller circle from the larger one to get the shaded area?\n\nYes, definitely. Let me confirm that. The area of the larger circle minus the area of the smaller one gives the area of the annulus, or the shaded region between them. So, the shaded area would be \u03c0(29\u00b2) - \u03c0(19\u00b2). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 29 squared: 29*29. Let me do that. 30 squared is 900, minus 29*1 (since 29*29 = (29+1-1)? Wait, no. 29*29 is equal to (29)\u00b2. Let me calculate it properly. 29*29: 29*20 is 580, plus 29*9 is 261, so total is 580+261=841. Then 19 squared is 361. So, 841 - 361. Hmm, 841 - 361. 841 - 300 is 541, then subtract 61 more: 541-61=480. So the shaded area is 480\u03c0. Hmm, okay.\n\nSo, the third circle has the same area as 480\u03c0. Let's denote the radius of the third circle as r. Then, the area of the third circle is \u03c0r\u00b2. Setting that equal to the shaded area:\n\n\u03c0r\u00b2 = 480\u03c0\n\nDivide both sides by \u03c0:\n\nr\u00b2 = 480\n\nThen take the square root of both sides:\n\nr = \u221a480\n\nNow, I need to simplify \u221a480. Let's factor 480 into prime factors to see if there's a way to simplify the radical.\n\nBreaking down 480:\n\n480 \u00f7 2 = 240\n\n240 \u00f7 2 = 120\n\n120 \u00f7 2 = 60\n\n60 \u00f7 2 = 30\n\n30 \u00f7 2 = 15\n\n15 \u00f7 3 = 5\n\n5 \u00f7 5 = 1\n\nSo, the prime factors are 2^5 * 3 * 5. Wait, let's check that:\n\n2^5 is 32, then 32*3=96, 96*5=480. Yes.\n\nSo, \u221a480 = \u221a(2^5 * 3 * 5). Let's separate the exponents into pairs. Since 2^5 is 2^4 * 2^1, so \u221a(2^4 * 2 * 3 * 5) = \u221a(2^4) * \u221a(2*3*5) = 2\u00b2 * \u221a(30) = 4\u221a30. So, simplifying \u221a480 gives 4\u221a30.\n\nTherefore, the radius of the third circle is 4\u221a30 units.\n\nWait a second, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The area of the inner circle is \u03c0*19\u00b2, which is 361\u03c0. The outer circle is \u03c0*29\u00b2, which is 841\u03c0. Subtracting, 841\u03c0 - 361\u03c0 = 480\u03c0. Then setting that equal to the third circle's area \u03c0r\u00b2 gives r\u00b2 = 480, so r = \u221a480. Breaking down 480 into prime factors as 2^5 * 3 * 5. Then grouping into pairs: 2^4 is 16, so two pairs of 2s, so 2\u00b2 is 4. The remaining factors are 2*3*5=30. So \u221a(16*30) = 4\u221a30.

So, we have two concentric circles with radii 19 and 29 units. The area between them is shaded, and we need to find the radius of a third circle whose area is equal to the shaded area. Hmm, concentric circles means they share the same center, right? So the shaded area would be the area between the two circles. \n\nFirst, I remember that the area of a circle is given by the formula \\( A = \\pi r^2 \\). Since there are two circles, the shaded area would be the area of the larger circle minus the area of the smaller one. That makes sense because the shaded region is the space outside the smaller circle but inside the larger one. \n\nLet me write that out. The area of the larger circle with radius 29 is \\( \\pi (29)^2 \\), and the area of the smaller circle with radius 19 is \\( \\pi (19)^2 \\). Subtracting them would give the shaded area:\n\nArea of shaded region = \\( \\pi (29)^2 - \\pi (19)^2 \\)\n\nI can factor out \\( \\pi \\) from both terms, so that simplifies to:\n\n\\( \\pi [ (29)^2 - (19)^2 ] \\)\n\nNow, I need to compute this expression. Let's calculate \\( 29^2 \\) and \\( 19^2 \\) first.\n\nCalculating \\( 29^2 \\):\n29 squared... Let me do this step by step. 20^2 is 400, 9^2 is 81, and then we have to adjust for the cross terms. Wait, maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, 29 * 29. Let me compute that:\n\n29 * 29: 20*20=400, 20*9=180, 9*20=180, 9*9=81. So adding those up: 400 + 180 + 180 + 81. Hmm, 400 + 180 is 580, plus another 180 is 760, plus 81 is 841. So 29 squared is 841.\n\nNow, 19 squared. Let's do the same.\n\n19 * 19. 10*10=100, 10*9=90, 9*10=90, 9*9=81. So 100 + 90 + 90 + 81 = 100 + 90 is 190, 190 + 90 is 280, 280 + 81 is 361. So 19 squared is 361.\n\nSo the difference between 29 squared and 19 squared is 841 - 361. Let me subtract that.\n\n841 - 361: 800 - 300 is 500, then 41 - 61 is negative. Wait, let me do it properly. 841 - 361 = 480. Let's check:\n\n361 + 480 = 841. Yes, that's correct.

Let me factor 480 into prime factors to see if it's a perfect square or can be simplified.\n\n480 divided by 16 is 30, so 480 = 16 * 30. 16 is a perfect square (4^2), and 30 is 2*3*5.

I need to figure out the radius of a third circle whose area is equal to the shaded area between two concentric circles with radii 19 and 29 units. Hmm, concentric circles mean they share the same center, so the shaded area would be the area between the larger circle (radius 29) and the smaller one (radius 19). \n\nFirst, I should recall the formula for the area of a circle, which is \u03c0r\u00b2. So, the area of the larger circle is \u03c0*(29)\u00b2, and the area of the smaller one is \u03c0*(19)\u00b2. The shaded area should be the difference between these two. Let me write that down:\n\nArea of larger circle = \u03c0 * (29)\u00b2  \nArea of smaller circle = \u03c0 * (19)\u00b2  \nShaded area = Area of larger - Area of smaller  \n= \u03c0*(29\u00b2 - 19\u00b2)  \n\nNow, I need to compute that difference. Let me compute 29 squared and 19 squared first. \n\n29 squared is 29*29. Let me calculate that. 30 squared is 900, so 29 squared is 900 minus 2*30 + 1 = 900 - 60 +1 = 841. Wait, hold on, 29\u00b2 is actually 841. Let me confirm:\n\n29*29:  \n20*20 = 400  \n20*9 = 180  \n9*20 = 180  \n9*9 = 81  \nAdding those: 400 + 180 + 180 +81 = 400 + 360 +81 = 400 + 441 = 841. Yes, that's correct. So 29\u00b2 = 841.\n\n19 squared is 19*19. Let's compute that. 20 squared is 400, subtract 2*20 +1 = 400 -40 +1= 360 +1= 361. So 19\u00b2 = 361. Let me check that manually:\n\n19*19:  \n10*10=100  \n10*9=90  \n9*10=90  \n9*9=81  \nAdding up: 100 +90 +90 +81= 100+180 +81= 280 +81= 361. Correct. So 19\u00b2=361.\n\nSo the shaded area is \u03c0*(841 - 361) = \u03c0*(480). Therefore, the shaded area is 480\u03c0.\n\nNow, the problem says a third circle will be drawn with the area equal to the shaded area. So the area of the third circle must also be 480\u03c0. Let me write that down:\n\nArea of third circle = \u03c0r\u00b2 = 480\u03c0  \nDivide both sides by \u03c0: r\u00b2 = 480  \nTake square root: r = \u221a480\n\nSimplify \u221a480. Let's factor 480 into prime factors to simplify the radical. \n\nFirst, divide by 16: 480 \u00f7 16 = 30. So 480 = 16 * 30. Then \u221a(16*30) = \u221a16 * \u221a30 = 4\u221a30. Since 16 is a perfect square. \n\nSo the radius of the third circle is 4\u221a30.\n\nWait, let me verify all the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Found the area of the larger circle: \u03c0*29\u00b2 = \u03c0*841, correct.  \n2. Found the area of the smaller circle: \u03c0*19\u00b2 = \u03c0*361, correct.  \n3. Subtracted them to get shaded area: \u03c0*(841 - 361) = \u03c0*480, correct.  \n4. Set up equation for the third circle's area: \u03c0r\u00b2 = 480\u03c0, so r\u00b2 = 480, r = \u221a480 = 4\u221a30, correct.  \n5. Simplify \u221a480: 16*30, so \u221a16*\u221a30 = 4\u221a30, correct.  \n\nYes, that seems right.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand the problem correctly. There are two circles that share the same center (they're concentric). The smaller circle has a radius of 19 units, and the larger one has a radius of 29 units. The area between them is shaded, so we need to calculate that area and then find the radius of a third circle with that same area.\n\nSince both circles are concentric, the shaded area is just the area of the larger circle minus the area of the smaller one. So, the formula for the area of a circle is \u03c0r\u00b2, right? Therefore, the area of the shaded region would be \u03c0*(29\u00b2) - \u03c0*(19\u00b2).\n\nLet me compute that. First, I need to square both radii:\n\n29 squared is 29*29. Let me do that multiplication. 29*20 is 580, and 29*9 is 261. Adding those together, 580 + 261 = 841. So, 29 squared is 841.\n\nSimilarly, 19 squared is 19*19. 19*20 is 380, subtract 19 to get 380 - 19 = 361. So, 19 squared is 361.\n\nTherefore, the area of the larger circle minus the smaller one is \u03c0*(841 - 361) = \u03c0*(480). So, the shaded area is 480\u03c0 square units.\n\nNow, I need to find the radius of a circle whose area is also 480\u03c0. Let's denote the radius of the third circle as r. The formula for the area of that circle would be \u03c0*(r\u00b2) = 480\u03c0.\n\nSince \u03c0 is on both sides of the equation, I can divide both sides by \u03c0 to simplify. That gives r\u00b2 = 480.\n\nTo find r, I take the square root of both sides. So, r = \u221a480.\n\nNow, I need to simplify \u221a480. Let's see. 480 can be factored into prime factors. Let me do that.\n\nWell, 480 divided by 10 is 48. So, 480 = 10 \u00d7 48. Then, 48 is 16 \u00d7 3. So, 480 = 10 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 3. Breaking that down further:\n\n10 = 2 \u00d7 5\n\n16 = 2^4\n\n3 is a prime number.\n\nSo, putting it all together, 480 = 2 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 2^4 \u00d7 3 = 2^(1 + 4) \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 = 2^5 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5.\n\nTherefore, \u221a480 can be written as \u221a(2^5 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5). Let's see how to simplify that radical.\n\nFirst, recall that \u221a(a^2 \u00d7 b) = a\u221ab. So, if we can write 480 as a square times something else, that square part will come out of the radical.\n\nLooking at the prime factors: 2^5, 3, 5. The exponents are 5, 1, 1. The highest even power less than 5 is 4. So 2^4 is 16, which is a perfect square. So, we can write \u221a(2^4 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5) = \u221a(2^4) \u00d7 \u221a(2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5) = 2^2 \u00d7 \u221a(30) = 4\u221a30.\n\nTherefore, \u221a480 simplifies to 4\u221a30. So, the radius of the third circle is 4\u221a30 units.\n\nLet me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, first, the area of the shaded region is \u03c0*(29\u00b2 - 19\u00b2) which is \u03c0*(841 - 361) = \u03c0*(480). Then, setting that equal to the area of the third circle: \u03c0r\u00b2 = 480\u03c0, so r\u00b2 = 480, which is correct. Then, simplifying \u221a480 to 4\u221a30. That seems right.

So, there are two concentric circles, meaning they share the same center, right? Their radii are 19 units and 29 units. The shaded region is between these two circles, so that must be the area between the two circles, isn't it? The question is asking for the radius of a third circle whose area is equal to the shaded region. Got it.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for the area of a circle. The area A is given by \u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius. So, since we're dealing with the shaded region, which is the area between the two circles, I think that means I need to subtract the area of the smaller circle from the area of the larger one. Let me write that down:\n\nArea of shaded region = Area of larger circle - Area of smaller circle\n= \u03c0*(29)\u00b2 - \u03c0*(19)\u00b2\n= \u03c0*(29\u00b2 - 19\u00b2)\n\nHmm, 29 squared minus 19 squared. That seems like a difference of squares, which factors into (29 - 19)(29 + 19). Let me check that:\n\n29\u00b2 - 19\u00b2 = (29 - 19)(29 + 19) = 10 * 48 = 480.\n\nWait, so the area of the shaded region is \u03c0*480. But the problem doesn't mention \u03c0 because it's asking for the radius of the third circle. So, does that mean I can just take the area of the shaded region and set it equal to \u03c0 times the radius squared of the third circle. Therefore, radius of third circle would be sqrt(area/\u03c0). Since the area is \u03c0*480, then radius would be sqrt(\u03c0*480 / \u03c0) = sqrt(480). Wait, but sqrt(480) can be simplified. Let me check that.\n\n480 factors into 16*30, which is 16*3*10. So, sqrt(16*3*10) is 4*sqrt(30). So, the radius is 4\u221a30. Let me verify if that's correct.\n\nFirst, let me confirm that the area calculation is right. The larger circle has radius 29, so its area is \u03c0*29\u00b2 = \u03c0*841. The smaller circle has radius 19, so its area is \u03c0*19\u00b2 = \u03c0*361. Subtracting these gives \u03c0*(841 - 361) = \u03c0*480. Correct. So the shaded area is indeed \u03c0*480.\n\nTherefore, the area of the third circle must also be \u03c0*480. The formula for the third circle's area is \u03c0r\u00b2. Setting those equal:\n\n\u03c0r\u00b2 = \u03c0*480\n\nDivide both sides by \u03c0:\n\nr\u00b2 = 480\n\nTake the square root:\n\nr = sqrt(480) = sqrt(16*30) = 4*sqrt(30)\n\nSo, the radius of the third circle is 4 times the square root of 30. That seems to check out. Let me just make sure there's no mistake in the problem setup.\n\nThe problem mentions two concentric circles with radii 19 and 29. The shaded region is the area between them, so subtracting the areas of the two circles. Then, the third circle has the same area as the shaded region. Therefore, the calculation is correct. The radius is indeed sqrt(480), which simplifies to 4\u221a30.

So, we have two concentric circles with radii 19 and 29 units. The shaded region is between these two circles, right? And we need to find the radius of a third circle that has the same area as this shaded region. \n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with areas of circles, the formula is \u03c0r\u00b2 where r is the radius. So maybe I need to find the area of the shaded region first. Since the shaded area is between the two circles, I should subtract the area of the smaller circle from the area of the larger one. That makes sense because concentric circles have the same center, so the area between them is the difference.\n\nLet me write that down. The area of the larger circle is \u03c0 times 29 squared, and the area of the smaller circle is \u03c0 times 19 squared. So, subtracting those gives the shaded area: \u03c0*29\u00b2 - \u03c0*19\u00b2. \n\nAlright, now I can factor out \u03c0 from both terms, which is good because both areas have \u03c0. So that gives me \u03c0*(29\u00b2 - 19\u00b2). Hmm, I recognize that 29 squared minus 19 squared is a difference of squares. Remember, the formula for a difference of squares is a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a - b)(a + b). So applying that here, it would be (29 - 19)(29 + 19). \n\nLet me compute those values. 29 minus 19 is 10. And 29 plus 19 is 48. So that simplifies the expression to \u03c0*(10*48). Then, 10 times 48 is 480. So the shaded area is \u03c0*480. \n\nWait a second, but the problem says to find the radius of a third circle with the same area. The area of a circle is \u03c0r\u00b2, so if we set that equal to \u03c0*480, then \u03c0r\u00b2 = \u03c0*480. I can divide both sides by \u03c0, which cancels out, leaving r\u00b2 = 480. Therefore, to find r, we take the square root of 480. \n\nBut 480 can be factored into prime factors to simplify the square root. Let me do that. 480 divided by 16 is 30. So 480 is 16*30. The square root of 16 is 4, so sqrt(480) = sqrt(16*30) = 4*sqrt(30). Therefore, the radius of the third circle is 4\u221a30.\n\nLet me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\n1. Calculated the area of the larger circle (29\u00b2) and smaller (19\u00b2): 29\u00b2 is 841, 19\u00b2 is 361. Subtracting gives 841 - 361 = 480. So shaded area is \u03c0*480. Correct.\n\n2. For the third circle, area is \u03c0r\u00b2 = \u03c0*480. Divide both sides by \u03c0: r\u00b2 = 480. Square root: r = sqrt(480) = 4\u221a30. That seems right.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me verify that sqrt(480) simplifies correctly. 480 factors into 16*30. 16 is 4\u00b2, so sqrt(16*30) = 4*sqrt(30). Yeah, that's correct. No mistakes there.\n\nSo the answer should be 4 times the square root of 30, which in boxed form is \\boxed{4\\sqrt{30}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe radius of the third circle is \\boxed{4\\sqrt{30}}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the radius of a third circle with the same area as the shaded region between two concentric circles with radii 19 and 29 units, we start by calculating the area of the shaded region. \n\nThe area of the larger circle is \\( \\pi \\times 29^2 \\) and the area of the smaller circle is \\( \\pi \\times 19^2 \\).

So, we have two concentric circles with radii 19 and 29 units. There's a shaded region between them, and we need to find the radius of a third circle whose area is equal to the area of that shaded region. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, concentric circles mean they share the same center, right? So, the shaded region is the area that's inside the larger circle (radius 29) but outside the smaller one (radius 19). To find the area of the shaded region, we need to subtract the area of the smaller circle from the area of the larger one. Then, take that result and find the radius of a circle with the same area.\n\nLet me start by calculating the area of the larger circle. The formula for the area of a circle is \u03c0r\u00b2, so for the larger circle (radius 29): \n\nArea of larger circle = \u03c0 * (29)\u00b2 = \u03c0 * 841.\n\nThen, the area of the smaller circle (radius 19):\n\nArea of smaller circle = \u03c0 * (19)\u00b2 = \u03c0 * 361.\n\nSubtracting the smaller area from the larger one gives the shaded area:\n\nShaded area = \u03c0 * 841 - \u03c0 * 361 = \u03c0*(841 - 361) = \u03c0*480.\n\nSo the shaded region has an area of 480\u03c0 square units.\n\nNow, we need to find the radius of a circle that has an area equal to this shaded region. Let's denote the radius of this third circle as r. The area of the third circle should be equal to 480\u03c0:\n\n\u03c0r\u00b2 = 480\u03c0.\n\nWe can divide both sides by \u03c0 to simplify:\n\nr\u00b2 = 480.\n\nTo find r, we take the square root of both sides:\n\nr = \u221a480.\n\nNow, let's simplify \u221a480 to its simplest radical form.

Let's group them:\n\n\u221a480 = \u221a(16 \u00d7 30) since 16 times 30 is 480 (16 is 2\u2074, and 30 is 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5). Wait, maybe another grouping would help?\n\nAlternatively, 480 = 16 \u00d7 30, but 16 is a perfect square, so that's better.\n\nWait, 480 divided by 16 is 30. So:\n\n\u221a480 = \u221a(16 * 30) = \u221a16 * \u221a30 = 4\u221a30.\n\nYes, that's right. Because 16 \u00d7 30 = 480, and \u221a16 is 4.\n\nSo, the simplified form of \u221a480 is 4\u221a30.\n\nTherefore, the radius r is 4\u221a30. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nOriginal calculation: Area of shaded region is 480\u03c0. The third circle's area must also be 480\u03c0, so r\u00b2 = 480 => r = sqrt(480) = sqrt(16*30) = 4*sqrt(30). Correct.\n\nSo, the radius of the third circle is 4\u221a30 units.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe radius of the third circle is \\boxed{4\\sqrt{30}}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the radius of the third circle with an area equal to the shaded region between two concentric circles with radii 19 and 29 units, we start by calculating the area of the shaded region. \n\nThe area of the larger circle (radius 29) is:\n\\[\n\\pi \\times 29^2 = \\pi \\times 841\n\\]\n\nThe area of the smaller circle (radius 19) is:\n\\[\n\\pi \\times 19^2 = \\pi \\times 361\n\\]\n\nSubtracting the area of the smaller circle from the larger circle gives the shaded area:\n\\[\n\\pi \\times 841 - \\pi \\times", 1.3899999856948853], ["25", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Hmm, let me think. Quadratic functions usually have their minimum or maximum at the vertex of the parabola they represent. Since the coefficient of the x\u00b2 term is positive (2), the parabola opens upwards, which means it has a minimum point. \n\nTo find the x-coordinate of the vertex, I remember there are a few methods. One is using the formula x = -b/(2a) from the standard form ax\u00b2 + bx + c. Another way is completing the square. Let me try both to check which one is easier here. \n\nFirst, let me recall the vertex formula. For a quadratic in the form y = ax\u00b2 + bx + c, the x-coordinate of the vertex is indeed -b/(2a). So plugging in the values here: a is 2, and b is -12. So substituting, x = -(-12)/(2*2) = 12/4 = 3. Okay, so x is 3. Then I can find the minimum value by plugging x = 3 back into the original equation. Let me compute that: 2*(3)\u00b2 - 12*(3) + 3. Calculating step by step: 3 squared is 9, times 2 is 18. Then -12*3 is -36. So 18 - 36 + 3. 18 - 36 is -18, plus 3 is -15. So the minimum value is -15. \n\nWait, but let me verify this using the completing the square method to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with 2x\u00b2 -12x +3. Since the coefficient of x\u00b2 is 2, I can factor that out first: 2(x\u00b2 -6x) +3. Now, to complete the square inside the parentheses. To complete the square for x\u00b2 -6x, take the coefficient of x, which is -6, divide by 2 to get -3, and then square it to get 9. So, x\u00b2 -6x +9 is a perfect square, which is (x - 3)\u00b2. But since we factored out a 2, we need to adjust the equation accordingly. Original expression is 2[(x\u00b2 -6x +9) -9] +3. That becomes 2(x - 3)\u00b2 - 18 +3. Simplify the constants: -18 +3 is -15. So the expression is 2(x -3)\u00b2 -15. \n\nThis is another way to see it. The vertex is at (3, -15), which matches what I found earlier. So both methods give me the same result. Therefore, I can confirm that x is indeed 3 and the minimum value is -15. \n\nJust to ensure I didn't slip up in my calculations, let me check the arithmetic again. For the formula method: -b/(2a) = -(-12)/(2*2) = 12/4 = 3. Correct. For the completing the square, expanding back: 2(x -3)\u00b2 -15. Distribute the 2 into the square: 2x\u00b2 -12x +18 -15. Combine constants: 18 -15 = 3. So the original quadratic is 2x\u00b2 -12x +3, which matches. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, I think my answer is solid. The value of x is 3, and the minimum value is -15. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( x \\) that gives the minimum value is \\boxed{3}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\) that gives the minimum value of the quadratic function \\( 2x^2 - 12x + 3 \\), we use the vertex formula for a quadratic function in the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\).

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that for a quadratic function in the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c, the vertex of the parabola (which is the point where the minimum or maximum occurs) can be found using the formula x = -b/(2a). Since the coefficient of x\u00b2 here is positive (2), the parabola opens upwards, meaning the vertex is the minimum point. So, I should use this formula to find the x-value where the minimum occurs.\n\nLet me check the coefficients again to make sure. The given function is 2x\u00b2 - 12x + 3. Comparing this to ax\u00b2 + bx + c, a is 2, b is -12. Yeah, so plugging into the vertex formula: x = -(-12)/(2*2) = 12/4 = 3. So, x = 3 should be the point where the minimum occurs. \n\nWait, let me verify this by also using calculus. If I take the derivative of the function with respect to x, set it equal to zero, and solve for x. The derivative of 2x\u00b2 is 4x, the derivative of -12x is -12, and the derivative of 3 is 0. So, the derivative f'(x) = 4x - 12. Setting this equal to zero: 4x - 12 = 0. Adding 12 to both sides gives 4x = 12, so x = 3. Same result. That checks out.\n\nIs there another way to think about this? Maybe completing the square? Let me try that. The original function is 2x\u00b2 -12x +3. Let's factor out the coefficient of x\u00b2 first. So, 2(x\u00b2 -6x) +3. Inside the parentheses, to complete the square, take half of the coefficient of x, which is -6, so half of that is -3. Then square it: (-3)\u00b2 = 9. So, inside the parentheses, we add and subtract 9. That gives 2[(x\u00b2 -6x +9 -9)] +3 = 2[(x -3)\u00b2 -9] +3. Distribute the 2: 2(x -3)\u00b2 -18 +3 = 2(x -3)\u00b2 -15. Now, looking at this form, the minimum value of the squared term (x -3)\u00b2 is 0, which occurs when x =3. Therefore, the minimum value of the function is -15. So, that confirms that x =3 gives the minimum value. \n\nI think that's thorough. So, all methods lead to x =3.

Hmm, let's think about how to approach this. Since this is a quadratic function, its graph is a parabola. If the coefficient of x\u00b2 is positive, the parabola opens upwards, which means it has a minimum point. If it's negative, it opens downward and has a maximum. Since the coefficient here is 2 (which is positive), the parabola will have a minimum. So I need to find the x-coordinate of the vertex of this parabola because the vertex of a parabola (since it opens upwards or downwards) is where the minimum or maximum occurs.\n\nThe vertex form of a quadratic function is f(x) = a(x - h)\u00b2 + k, where (h, k) is the vertex. But in this case, I don't have the function in vertex form, so maybe I should use the formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex. For a general quadratic function f(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c, the x-coordinate of the vertex is at x = -b/(2a). Let me verify that. Yeah, for the standard quadratic ax\u00b2 + bx + c, the vertex is at (-b/(2a), f(-b/(2a))). So in this problem, a is 2 and b is -12. Let me apply that formula.\n\nSo plugging in the values, the x-coordinate is -(-12)/(2*2). The negatives cancel out, so that's 12/(4) which simplifies to 3. So x = 3. Therefore, the minimum value occurs at x = 3. Let me confirm this by also checking the first derivative method, just to be thorough.\n\nThe first derivative of f(x) is f'(x) = d/dx [2x\u00b2 -12x + 3] = 4x -12. Setting this equal to zero to find critical points: 4x -12 = 0. Solving for x: 4x =12 => x=3. That's the same result as before. So that confirms that the critical point is at x=3. Since the parabola opens upwards, this critical point is indeed the minimum.\n\nLet me also check the second derivative to ensure it's positive, confirming a minimum. The second derivative is f''(x) = d/dx [4x -12] = 4, which is positive. So the function is concave up at x=3, so it's a minimum. Therefore, x=3 is the correct value.\n\nAlternatively, I can sketch a rough graph mentally. The function 2x\u00b2 -12x +3 is a parabola opening upwards. The vertex is at x=3, so the graph is shifted to the right of the y-axis and left of the origin. Since the minimum is at x=3, that's where the function reaches its lowest point. To verify, plugging x=3 into the original equation gives 2*(9) -12*(3) +3 = 18 -36 +3 = -15. The value at x=3 is -15, which is indeed the minimum as the parabola opens upwards.\n\nAnother way to check is by completing the square. Let's try that. Starting with 2x\u00b2 -12x +3. Factor out the coefficient of x\u00b2 first: 2(x\u00b2 -6x) +3. Now, complete the square inside the parentheses. Take half of -6, which is -3, square it to get 9. So we add and subtract 9 inside the parentheses: 2[(x\u00b2 -6x +9 -9)] +3 = 2[(x -3)^2 -9] +3 = 2(x -3)^2 -18 +3 = 2(x -3)^2 -15. So the vertex form is 2(x -3)^2 -15, which shows that the minimum value is -15 when x=3.\n\nYes, all these methods lead to the same conclusion. Therefore, the value of x that gives the minimum value of the function is 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( x \\) that gives the minimum value is \\boxed{3}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\) that gives the minimum value of the quadratic function \\( f(x) = 2x^2 - 12x + 3 \\):\n\n1. **Identify the quadratic form**: The function is in the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) where \\( a = 2 \\), \\( b = -12 \\), and \\( c = 3 \\).\n\n2", 1.409999966621399], ["25", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Hmm, quadratic functions... I remember that the graph of a quadratic is a parabola. For parabolas that open upwards, which is the case here since the coefficient of x\u00b2 is positive (2), the vertex of the parabola is the lowest point, which would be the minimum value. \n\nWait, but how exactly do I find the x-coordinate of the vertex? I recall that for a quadratic equation in standard form ax\u00b2 + bx + c, the x-coordinate of the vertex is given by -b/(2a). Let me verify that. Yeah, that formula makes sense because the vertex is exactly halfway between the roots, which is why the derivative at x equals -b/(2a) would be zero. So, plugging in the values from the given equation into that formula should work.\n\nLooking at the equation: 2x\u00b2 -12x +3. So, the coefficients are a = 2, b = -12, and c = 3. Plugging into the vertex formula: -b/(2a) would be -(-12)/(2*2). Let me compute that. The negative of b is -(-12) which is positive 12. Then divided by 2a: 2*2 is 4. So, 12/4 is 3. So, x = 3. \n\nWait, so the x-value that gives the minimum is 3. Let me check by plugging back into the original equation. If x = 3, then 2*(3)^2 -12*(3) +3. Let me compute each term step by step. 3 squared is 9, times 2 is 18. Then 12 times 3 is 36, subtracted from 18 gives -18, then plus 3 gives -15. So, the minimum value is -15 when x=3. \n\nBut let me also verify by completing the square. That another way to find the vertex. Let's take the original equation: 2x\u00b2 -12x +3. First, factor out the coefficient of x\u00b2 from the first two terms. So, 2(x\u00b2 -6x) +3. Now, to complete the square inside the parentheses. Take the coefficient of x, which is -6, divide by 2 to get -3, square it to get 9. So, we add and subtract 9 inside the parentheses. So, 2[(x\u00b2 -6x +9 -9)] +3. That becomes 2[(x -3)^2 -9] +3. Distribute the 2: 2(x -3)^2 -18 +3. So, -18 +3 is -15. So, the equation becomes 2(x -3)^2 -15. That matches what I got before by the vertex formula. So, the minimum value is -15 when x=3. \n\nAlright, so both methods confirm that x=3 gives the minimum value. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. When I applied the vertex formula, a=2, b=-12: -(-12)/(2*2) = 12/4 = 3. Correct. Then plugging back into the original equation: 2*(9) -12*(3) +3 =18 -36 +3 = -15. That checks out. Completing the square also gives the same result. So, I think that's solid. \n\nIs there any chance I misapplied something here? For instance, is the coefficient of x\u00b2 positive, so the parabola opens upwards, meaning the vertex is indeed the minimum. That seems right. And the vertex coordinates method is a standard formula. Yeah, the steps make sense. \n\nAnother thing to check: Suppose x=3 is correct. Let me pick x=3+1=4 and x=3-1=2, and see if the value is increasing or decreasing. Let's compute f(3)= -15, f(4)=2*(16) -12*(4) +3=32 -48 +3= -13. f(2)=2*(4) -12*(2)+3=8 -24 +3= -13. So, moving from 2 to 3 to 4 gives -15 to -13 to -13. So, the value increases after x=3, which means x=3 is indeed a minimum. \n\nTherefore, I'm confident that x=3 gives the minimum value of -15. \n\n**Answer**\nThe value of \\( x", 0.49000000953674316], ["25", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Let's compute that step by step. 3 squared is 9, so 2*9 is 18. Then 12*3 is 36. So 18 - 36 + 3. That's 18 - 36 is -18, and -18 + 3 is -15. So the minimum value is -15 when x is 3. Let me just cross-check using another method to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can convert the quadratic into vertex form by completing the square. Starting with 2x\u00b2 - 12x + 3. First, factor out the coefficient of x\u00b2 from the first two terms: 2(x\u00b2 - 6x) + 3. Now, to complete the square inside the parentheses, take half of the coefficient of x, which is -6, so half of that is -3, square it to get 9. So add and subtract 9 inside the parentheses: 2[(x\u00b2 - 6x + 9 - 9)] + 3. That becomes 2[(x - 3)\u00b2 - 9] + 3. Distribute the 2: 2(x - 3)\u00b2 - 18 + 3. Combine like terms: 2(x - 3)\u00b2 - 15. So that's the vertex form, which is a parabola that opens upwards with vertex at (3, -15). Yep, that confirms it. So the minimum value is -15 at x = 3.\n\nI think that's it.

Let me try applying that here. Here, a = 2 and b = -12. Plugging those into the formula gives x = -(-12)/(2*2) = 12/4 = 3. So according to this, the minimum should occur at x = 3. Let me verify that by calculating the value of the function at x = 3 and also check nearby points to make sure it's indeed the minimum.\n\nFirst, plugging x = 3 into the equation: 2*(3)\u00b2 -12*(3) +3. Let's compute that step by step. 3 squared is 9, so 2*9 = 18. Then 12*3 = 36. So 18 - 36 + 3. That's 18 - 36 is -18, and -18 +3 is -15. So at x =3, the value is -15. \n\nNow let's check a point to the left, say x = 2. Plugging in: 2*(2)\u00b2 -12*(2) +3. That's 2*4 =8, 12*2=24, so 8 -24 +3. 8-24 is -16, -16+3 is -13. That's higher than -15, so x=3 gives a lower value.\n\nHow about x =4? Let's check: 2*4\u00b2 -12*4 +3. 2*16=32, 12*4=48. 32-48+3. 32-48 is -16, -16+3 is -13 again. Still higher than -15. So yes, x=3 seems to give the minimum value. \n\nAlternatively, I can remember that the vertex formula is a standard result and applying it here is straightforward. So yeah, I think x=3 is the correct answer. Let me also cross-validate using calculus. Taking the derivative of the function: f(x) = 2x\u00b2 -12x +3, so f'(x) = 4x -12. Setting derivative equal to zero: 4x -12 =0. Solving for x gives x=12/4=3. Then further derivative f''(x)=4, which is positive, indicating a minimum. So that also confirms the vertex at x=3 is indeed the minimum. \n\nTherefore, after checking multiple methods and verifying with different points, I'm confident that x=3 is the value that gives the minimum value of the function.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( x \\) that gives the minimum value is \\boxed{3}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\) that gives the minimum value of the quadratic function \\( 2x^2 - 12x + 3 \\), we use the vertex formula for a parabola.

Hmm, okay. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that quadratic functions have a parabolic graph which either opens upwards or downwards. The minimum point of this parabola should be the vertex. Since the coefficient of x\u00b2 is positive (2), the parabola opens upwards, which means the vertex is the minimum point. So, the x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula x = -b/(2a). Let me confirm that.\n\nWait, the general form of a quadratic is f(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c. Yes, in this case, a is 2, b is -12. So substituting those into the formula, x = -b/(2a) would be -(-12)/(2*2) = 12/4 = 3. So, x = 3? That seems straightforward. Let me check if that makes sense. If I plug x = 3 back into the function, the term 2x\u00b2 becomes 2*(9) = 18, the -12x becomes -12*3 = -36, and the constant term is 3. Adding those up: 18 - 36 + 3 = (18 + 3) - 36 = 21 - 36 = -15. So the minimum value is -15 when x = 3.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should verify this using completing the square method to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's try that. Starting with f(x) = 2x\u00b2 - 12x + 3. Factor out the coefficient of x\u00b2 from the first two terms: 2(x\u00b2 - 6x) + 3. Now, inside the parentheses, to complete the square, take half of the coefficient of x, which is -6, so half is -3, square it to get 9. So add and subtract 9 inside the parentheses: 2[(x\u00b2 - 6x + 9) - 9] + 3. Distribute the 2: 2(x - 3)\u00b2 - 18 + 3. Combine constants: -18 + 3 = -15. So again, f(x) = 2(x - 3)\u00b2 - 15. Therefore, the vertex is at (3, -15), so the minimum value is -15 when x = 3. That matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, differentiation. If I take the derivative of f(x), set it equal to zero, and solve for x. The derivative f'(x) = 4x - 12. Setting that equal to zero: 4x - 12 = 0 => 4x = 12 => x = 3. Yep, same result. So that seems to confirm it. Therefore, the value of x that gives the minimum is 3.\n\nWait, just to make sure there's no trick here. Sometimes, functions can have restrictions or something, but in this case, it's a quadratic function with no restrictions on x, so the vertex is the only critical point, and since the parabola opens upwards, it's indeed the minimum.\n\nAnother way to think about it: completing the square gave me the vertex form, so the answer is obvious. If I didn't remember the formula, I could derive it by factoring or using calculus, both leading to x = 3. So, confident that's the correct answer.\n\nI think that's it. The key was recognizing that the coefficient was positive, so it's a minimum, applying the vertex formula, verification by completing the square or calculus, all confirming x = 3 gives the minimum value of -15.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( x \\) that gives the minimum value is \\boxed{3}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\) that gives the minimum value of the quadratic function \\( f(x) = 2x^2 - 12x + 3 \\):\n\n1. **Identify the coefficients**: The quadratic function is in the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) where \\( a = 2 \\), \\( b = -12 \\), and \\( c = 3 \\).\n\n2. **Use the vertex formula**: The x-coordinate of the vertex of a quadratic function \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) is given by \\( x = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\).\n   \\[\n   x = -\\frac{-12}{2 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{12}{4} = 3\n   \\]\n\n3", 1.5099999904632568], ["25", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Hmm, let's see. I remember that to evaluate a polynomial at a specific point, I just substitute the value of x into the expression and compute each term step by step. Let me try that here.\n\nFirst, replacing x with -2 in each term. Let's start with the first term: 8x\u00b3. Since x is -2, that becomes 8*(-2)\u00b3. Let me compute the exponent part first. (-2)\u00b3 is -2 multiplied by itself three times: (-2)*(-2) = 4, then 4*(-2) = -8. So that term is 8*(-8) = ... Well, 8 times -8 is -64. Okay, so the first term is -64.\n\nNext term is -6x\u00b2. Again, x is -2. So (-2)\u00b2 is 4 because 2 multiplied by itself is 4. Then multiply by -6: -6*4 = -24. So that term is -24.\n\nThird term is -4x. Plugging in x = -2, this becomes -4*(-2). Multiplying those gives (-4)*(-2) = 8. So that term is 8.\n\nThe last term is just 5, because there's no x in it. So adding up all these terms together: -64 (from the first term) -24 (second term) +8 (third term) +5 (last term). Wait, let me confirm that. So total value is (-64) + (-24) + 8 +5. Let me compute that step by step. \n\nFirst, combine -64 and -24: that's -88. Then add 8: -88 + 8 = -80. Then add 5: -80 +5 = -75. So f(-2) should be -75? Let me check my steps again to be sure.\n\nStarting with (-2)\u00b3: (-2)*(-2)=4, then 4*(-2)=-8. Multiply by 8: 8*(-8)= -64. Correct. Then (-2)\u00b2=4. Multiply by -6: -6*4=-24. Correct. Then (-6*2)= -8. Correct. Then +5. So altogether: -64 -24 +8 +5. Let me add them up again: -64 -24 is -88. Then -88 +8 is -80. Then -80 +5 is -75. Yeah, that's right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can factor something out? Let's see. The polynomial is 8x\u00b3 -6x\u00b2 -4x +5. If I factor out the greatest common factor (GCF), but looking at the coefficients: 8, -6, -4, 5. The GCF of 8 and -6 is 2, but also -4 and 5 have no common factors with 2. So maybe there's no GCF. So factoring might not help here.\n\nAnother approach: maybe think of plugging in -2 into the function term by term. Let's confirm each term separately:\n\nFirst term: 8*(-2)^3. As computed, (-2)^3 is -8, so 8*(-8) = -64. Correct.\n\nSecond term: -6*(-2)^2. (-2)^2 is 4, so -6*4 = -24. Correct.\n\nThird term: -4*(-2). That's 8. Correct.\n\nFourth term: 5. Correct.\n\nSo all terms are correctly calculated. Then adding them up: -64 -24 +8 +5. Let's do the arithmetic again:\n\n-64 -24 is -88. -88 +8 is -80. -80 +5 is indeed -75. So yes, f(-2) = -75.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just check using another method to be thorough. Maybe synthetic division? Let's try that.\n\nUsing synthetic division to find f(-2):\n\nWrite the coefficients: 8 (from 8x\u00b3), -6 (from -6x\u00b2), -4 (from -4x), and 5 (constant term). Then use -2 as the root.\n\nSet up the synthetic division:\n\n-2 | 8 \u00a0 \u00a0-6 \u00a0 \u00a0-4 \u00a0 \u00a05\n\nBring down the 8.\n\nMultiply 8 by -2: 8*(-2) = -16.

Let's see, how do I approach this? Well, substitution. That means I just plug in -2 wherever there's an x in the equation. Let me write that down step by step to make sure I don't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, let me write down the original function again: f(x) = 8x\u00b3 - 6x\u00b2 - 4x + 5. Then, substitute x with -2. So, f(-2) = 8*(-2)\u00b3 - 6*(-2)\u00b2 - 4*(-2) + 5. Hmm, okay. Let's compute each term one by one.\n\nStarting with the first term: 8*(-2)\u00b3. The cube of -2 is (-2)*(-2)*(-2). Let's calculate that. (-2)*(-2) is 4, and then 4*(-2) is -8. So, (-2)\u00b3 is -8. Then multiply by 8: 8*(-8) equals -64. Okay, first term is -64.\n\nMoving on to the second term: -6*(-2)\u00b2. The square of -2 is (-2)*(-2) which is 4. So, (-2)\u00b2 is 4. Then multiply by -6: -6*4 = -24. So, the second term is -24.\n\nThird term: -4*(-2). That's straightforward multiplication. -4 times -2 is 8. So, the third term is 8.\n\nNow, the last term is just 5, right?\n\nSo, adding all these terms together: -64 -24 +8 +5.\n\nLet me compute that step by step. First, -64 -24. That's -88. Then, add 8 to that. -88 +8 is -80. Then, add 5: -80 +5 = -75. So, f(-2) should be -75.

Then x\u00b2: (-2)\u00b2 is 4. 6*4 is 24, but since there's a negative sign in front, it's -24. Then -4*(-2) is 8. The constants: +5. Adding them all: -64 -24 +8 +5. Let's do that again:\n\n-64 -24 is -88. Then -88 +8 is -80. Then -80 +5 is -75. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can check the calculation by breaking it down differently.

Multiply by -6: -6*4 = -24. Correct.\n\nThird term: -4*(-2) = 8. Correct.\n\nFourth term: 5. Correct.\n\nAdding them: -64 -24 +8 +5. Let's add in reverse order for confirmation:\n\nStart with -64 -24: that's -88.\n\nThen -88 +8: that's -80.\n\nThen -80 +5: that's -75.\n\nYes, no mistakes here.

First, (-2)\u00b3 is (-2)*(-2)*(-2). Multiplying two negatives gives a positive, then multiply by another negative. So, (-2)^2 is 4, and then multiplied by -2 gives -8. Then multiplied by 8, so 8*(-8) = -64. Wait, hold on. Let me verify that again. \n\nDefinitely, (-2)\u00b3 is -8? Let's check: (-2) * (-2) = 4, 4 * (-2) = -8. Yes, so (-2)\u00b3 is indeed -8. Therefore, multiplying by 8 gives 8*(-8) = -64. Okay, so that term is -64. Got that down.\n\nNext term: -6*(-2)^2. Let's compute (-2)^2 first. That's 4. Then multiply by -6: (-6)*4 = -24.

Let me write that out step by step.\n\nStart with -64. Then subtract 24. So -64 - 24. Let me do that: -64 -20 is -84, then minus 4 more is -88. Hmm. Then add 8. So -88 +8 is -80. Wait, is that right?

The function is given by f(x) = 8x\u00b3 - 6x\u00b2 - 4x + 5. Hmm, let me think step by step how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that to find f(-2), I just need to substitute -2 into every x in the function and then calculate each term step by step. Let's write that down. So replacing x with -2 in each term:\n\nStarting with the first term: 8x\u00b3. Substitute x with -2: 8*(-2)\u00b3. Let me calculate that. The exponent is 3, so (-2) cubed is (-2)*(-2)*(-2). Let's compute that: (-2)*(-2) is 4, then 4*(-2) is -8. So 8*(-8) equals -64.\n\nSecond term: -6x\u00b2. Substitute x with -2: -6*(-2)\u00b2. Again, the exponent is 2, so (-2) squared is 4. Then multiply by -6: -6*4 = -24.\n\nThird term: -4x. Substitute x with -2: -4*(-2). That's straightforward: -4 times -2 is 8.\n\nFourth term is just the constant: +5. So we don't need to substitute anything here; it stays 5.\n\nNow, let's add all these terms together: -64 (from the first term) minus 24 (from the second) plus 8 (from the third) plus 5 (from the fourth). Let me check that again:\n\nFilling in numbers: -64 -24 +8 +5.\n\nLet's do the addition step by step. First, combine -64 and -24: -64 -24 = -88.\n\nThen add 8: -88 +8 = -80.\n\nFinally, add 5: -80 +5 = -75.\n\nWait, so does that mean f(-2) is -75? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't mix up any signs or make a calculation error.\n\nStarting with 8*(-2)^3: (-2)^3 is -8, 8*(-8) is indeed -64. Correct.\n\nSecond term: -6*(-2)^2. (-2)^2 is 4, so -6*4 is -24. Correct.\n\nThird term: -4*(-2) is 8. Correct.\n\nFourth term: 5. Correct.\n\nSo adding them up: -64 -24 = -88. -88 +8 = -80. -80 +5 = -75. Yes, that seems right. Wait, but maybe I can verify by calculating each term separately:\n\n8*(-2)^3: 8*(-8) = -64\n\n-6*(-2)^2: -6*(4) = -24\n\n-4*(-2): -4*(-2) = 8\n\n+5: +5\n\nAdding all together: -64 -24 +8 +5.\n\nLet's add -64 and -24 first: -88. Then add 8: -80. Then add 5: -75. Yes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, is there another way to check this? Maybe using synthetic division or polynomial division? But since f(-2) is a common way to evaluate polynomials, perhaps that's straightforward. But just to be thorough, let's try synthetic division to confirm.\n\nThe polynomial is f(x) = 8x\u00b3 -6x\u00b2 -4x +5. To evaluate at x = -2, using synthetic division:\n\nSet up coefficients: 8 | -6 | -4 | 5 (since there's no x term, we put 0x\u00b2)\n\nWrite -2 to the left.\n\nBring down the 8.\n\nMultiply 8 by -2: -16. Add to next coefficient: -6 + (-16) = -22.\n\nMultiply -22 by -2: 44. Add to next coefficient: -4 +44 =40.\n\nMultiply 40 by -2: -80. Add to last coefficient:5 + (-80) = -75.\n\nSo the result is -75, which matches my previous calculation. Great, so that's a good confirmation.\n\nAnother way to check is maybe evaluating each term step by step again:\n\n8x\u00b3: x=-2, so (-2)^3= -8. 8*(-8)=-64.

Hmm, let me think step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that when evaluating a polynomial at a specific value of x, you just substitute that value into the polynomial and then simplify. So here, x is -2. Let me write that down: f(-2) = 8*(-2)\u00b3 - 6*(-2)\u00b2 - 4*(-2) + 5. \n\nAlright, let's compute each term one by one. Starting with the first term: 8*(-2)\u00b3. The exponent here is 3, so I need to calculate (-2) cubed first. (-2)*(-2) is 4, right? And then 4* (-2) is -8. So that takes care of the first term: 8*(-8) = -64. Cool, now moving on.\n\nNext term: -6*(-2)\u00b2. Let's compute the exponent first. The exponent is 2, so (-2)\u00b2 is (-2)*(-2) = 4. Then multiply by -6: -6*4 = -24. So the second term is -24. Hmm, third term: -4*(-2). Multiplying -4 and (-2) is... 8. So that term is +8. \n\nFinally, the constant term is just +5. \n\nSo putting it all together, f(-2) = -64 -24 +8 +5. Let me check that again. \n\nStarting with -64 (from the first term), subtract 24 (second term), which gives -88, then add 8 (third term) which becomes -80, then add 5 (constant term) to get -75. Hmm, seems right. Let me verify the calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst term: 8*(-2)^3. 8 times (-2* -2* -2). The first two multiplications: (-2)*(-2) = 4, then 4*(-2) = -8. Then 8*(-8) = -64. Correct. \n\nSecond term: -6*(-2)^2. (-2)^2 is 4, then multiply by -6: -6*4 = -24. Correct. \n\nThird term: -4*(-2). Multiplying negatives here: -4* -2 = 8. Correct. \n\nConstant term: +5. \n\nAdding them all together: -64 -24 +8 +5. Let's add them in order. \n\nStarting with -64 -24: that's -88. Then -88 +8: that's -80. Then -80 +5: that's -75. Yes, that seems right. \n\nWait, but maybe I should check if I did the exponents right. Let me confirm again. \n\nFor the first term, x is -2, so (-2)^3. Let's do this multiplication step by step: (-2)*(-2) is 4, then 4*(-2) is -8. Yes, that's correct. \n\nSecond term, exponent 2 on -2, so (-2)^2 is 4. Then multiplied by -6: -6*4 = -24. Correct. \n\nThird term, -4*(-2). Multiply -4 and -2: the negatives cancel out, so 8. Correct. \n\nSo all the exponents were calculated correctly. Then combining them: -64 -24 is indeed -88, plus 8 gives -80, plus 5 gives -75. So f(-2) = -75. \n\nI think that's right. Let me just check another way. Maybe plugging in x=-2 into the original equation step by step. \n\nOriginal function: 8x\u00b3 -6x\u00b2 -4x +5. \n\nx=-2:\n\n8*(-2)^3: as before, 8*(-8) = -64. \n\n-6*(-2)^2: -6*4 = -24. \n\n-4*(-2): -4*(-2) = 8. \n\n+5. \n\nSo adding them together: -64 -24 +8 +5. \n\nYes, same result. So I think it's definitely -75. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a shortcut. For polynomials, sometimes you can factor or use some properties, but since this is a cubic, there might not be a straightforward factorization. Alternatively, using synthetic division for evaluating at x=-2. \n\nLet me try that method to see if I get the same result.

Hmm, let's see. Alright, let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that when evaluating a polynomial at a specific point, you just substitute the value of x into the equation and then compute each term one by one. So in this case, x is -2. Let me write that down. \n\nSo, f(-2) = 8*(-2)\u00b3 - 6*(-2)\u00b2 - 4*(-2) + 5. Let me check if that makes sense. Yeah, each term has x raised to a power multiplied by the coefficient. Now, I need to compute each term individually.\n\nStarting with the first term: 8*(-2)\u00b3. Let's compute (-2)\u00b3 first. (-2) multiplied by itself three times. So (-2)*(-2) = 4, then 4*(-2) = -8. So, that term is 8 times -8, which is -64. \n\nNext term: -6*(-2)\u00b2. Let's compute (-2)\u00b2 first. That's (-2)*(-2) = 4. Then multiply by -6: -6*4 = -24. \n\nThird term: -4*(-2). That's straightforward. -4 multiplied by -2 is 8. \n\nThen the last term is just 5, since there's no x in the fifth term.\n\nNow, putting all these terms together: -64 (from the first term) minus 24 (the second term) plus 8 (the third term) plus 5. Wait, hold on. Let me check the signs again. The first term is 8*(-2)\u00b3, which we calculated as -64. The second term is -6*(-2)\u00b2, which we calculated as -24. The third term is -4*(-2), which is 8. So, writing that all out:\n\nf(-2) = (-64) - (-24) + 8 + 5. Let's simplify step by step. \n\nFirst, -64 - (-24) is the same as -64 + 24. Let's compute that: -64 + 24. Hmm, 64 minus 24 is 40, so with the negative sign, that's -40. Then we add 8 and 5. So, -40 + 8 is -32, and -32 + 5 is -27. \n\nWait, let me verify that again. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst term: 8*(-2)^3. (-2)^3 is -8, multiplied by 8 is -64. Correct. \n\nSecond term: -6*(-2)^2. (-2)^2 is 4, multiplied by -6 is -24. Correct. \n\nThird term: -4*(-2). That's -4*(-2) which is 8. Correct. \n\nFourth term: +5. Correct. \n\nSo now adding them up: -64 -24 +8 +5. \n\nFirst, combine the negatives: -64 -24 = -88. Then add 8 and 5: -88 +8 is -80, then -80 +5 is -75. Wait, but earlier I got -27. That's a discrepancy. Hmm, maybe I messed up that step. Let me check again. \n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated the next term. Let's go back. \n\nFirst term: -64. Second term: -6*(-2)^2. (-2)^2 is 4. So, -6*4 = -24. Then third term: -4*(-2) = 8. Then fourth term: +5. \n\nSo, f(-2) = -64 (first term) - (-24) (second term) + 8 (third term) +5 (fourth term). \n\nWhich is -64 +24 +8 +5. Let's compute step by step. \n\nStart with -64 +24. That's -40. Then add 8: -40 +8 is -32. Then add 5: -32 +5 is -27. \n\nAh, right. So the correct result is -27. \n\nSo, f(-2) = -27.

So, we have 50 dogs that can sit, 29 that can stay, 34 that can roll over, and some who can do different combinations of these tricks. Also, 9 dogs can do none of the tricks, and we need to find the total number of dogs in the school. This seems like a classic inclusion-exclusion problem, right?\n\nFirst, let me recall the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets. If we have three sets A, B, and C, the total number of elements in any of the sets is:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \u2229 B| - |A \u2229 C| - |B \u2229 C| + |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|\n\nThen, if we need to include those who do none of the tricks, we just add the number of dogs that can do none. The formula would be:\n\nTotal = |A \u222a B \u222a C| + n(not A, not B, not C)\n\nWhere n(not A, not B, not C) is given as 9.\n\nSo, first, let me write down the given numbers:\n\n- |A| = 50 (dogs that can sit)\n- |B| = 29 (dogs that can stay)\n- |C| = 34 (dogs that can roll over)\n- |A \u2229 B| = 17\n- |A \u2229 C| = 12\n- |B \u2229 C| = 18\n- |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| = 9\n- n(not A, not B, not C) = 9\n\nSo, substituting these into the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets:\n\nTotal = (50 + 29 + 34) - (17 + 12 + 18) + 9\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, sum |A| + |B| + |C|: 50 + 29 + 34. Let me add 50 + 29 first. 50 + 29 is 79, then 79 + 34 is 113. So that's 113.\n\nThen, compute |A \u2229 B| + |A \u2229 C| + |B \u2229 C|: 17 + 12 + 18. 17 + 12 is 29, plus 18 is 47. So that's 47.\n\nSubtract the second sum from the first: 113 - 47. Let me do that. 113 - 40 is 73, then subtract 7 more: 73 - 7 = 66. So total of three intersections is 66.\n\nThen, add back the intersection of all three: 66 + 9 = 75.\n\nThen, add the dogs that can do none: 75 + 9 = 84.\n\nWait, so total dogs in the school would be 84? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic mistake.\n\nStarting again:\n\nSum of all individual counts: 50 + 29 + 34. Let's verify:\n\n50 + 29: 50 + 29 = 79. 79 + 34: 79 + 30 = 109, 109 + 4 = 113. Correct.\n\nSum of all pairwise intersections: 17 + 12 + 18. 17 + 12 is 29. 29 + 18 is 47. Correct.\n\nSubtracting the pairwise intersections from the total: 113 - 47 = 66. Wait, 113 minus 47. Let me do 113 - 40 = 73, then -7 = 66. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAdd back the triple intersection: 66 + 9 = 75. Then add the 9 dogs that do none: 75 + 9 = 84. Hmm, correct.\n\nWait, let me check if inclusion-exclusion is really the right approach here. The problem states dogs can learn to sit, stay, and roll over. But all the dogs are in these three tricks, right? The problem doesn't mention dogs that don't do any tricks, which would be the 9 dogs.

The problem gives us a lot of information about which dogs can perform different tricks: sit, stay, or roll over. Also, it mentions some dogs can do more than one trick. Hmm, this sounds like a problem where I need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Wait, inclusion-exclusion is used to count the number of elements in the union of multiple sets by adding the sizes of the individual sets, subtracting the sizes of their pairwise intersections, adding back the size of the intersection of all three, etc. Let me recall the formula.\n\nThe total number of dogs that can perform any of the three tricks (sit, stay, or roll over) would be the sum of the individual sets minus the sum of the pairwise intersections plus the intersection of all three. Then, finally, we need to add the dogs that can do none of the tricks, right? So the total number of dogs in the school should be the number of dogs that can perform at least one trick plus the dogs that can do none. \n\nLet me structure this step by step. Let me denote:\n\n- S: dogs that can sit\n- T: dogs that can stay\n- R: dogs that can roll over\n\nGiven:\n\nS = 50\nT = 29\nR = 34\n\nIntersections:\n\nS and T = 17\nT and R = 12\nS and R = 18\n\nAll three = 9\n\nNone = 9\n\nSo, according to inclusion-exclusion, the number of dogs that can perform at least one trick (S \u222a T \u222a R) is:\n\nS + T + R - (S \u2229 T) - (T \u2229 R) - (S \u2229 R) + (S \u2229 T \u2229 R)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n50 + 29 + 34 - 17 - 12 - 18 + 9\n\nLet me compute step by step. First, add all the individual sets: 50 + 29 + 34. Let's see:\n\n50 + 29 = 79, then 79 + 34 = 113. So that's 113.\n\nNow subtract the pairwise intersections: 17 + 12 + 18. Let's add those: 17 + 12 = 29, then 29 + 18 = 47. So subtract that from 113: 113 - 47 = 66.\n\nThen add the intersection of all three: 66 + 9 = 75. So that gives us 75 dogs that can perform at least one trick.\n\nTherefore, the total number of dogs in the school is 75 (those that can perform at least one trick) plus 9 (those that can't perform any) = 75 + 9 = 84 dogs.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Maybe I made an arithmetic mistake. Let me check again:\n\n50 + 29 = 79\n\n79 + 34 = 113\n\n17 + 12 = 29\n\n29 + 18 = 47\n\n113 - 47 = 66\n\n66 + 9 = 75\n\nYes, that's correct. Then 75 + 9 = 84. Hmm, seems right. Let me think if there's any possible error in the problem statement. For example, maybe the counts are different? Wait, the problem says \"Of the dogs at the school\" so the 50, 29, 34 are the total numbers who can do those tricks. But does that include those who can do multiple tricks? For instance, 50 positions for sitting are all dogs who can sit, sitting being a trick. But these 50 dogs could also be doing staying or rolling over as well. So, the numbers given include overlaps. So, the numbers we use in inclusion-exclusion are correct.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 84. Let me check once more. If 75 dogs can do at least one trick, and 9 can't, total is 84. That seems correct. Wait, but is there any other possible interpretation? For example, can a dog be numbered in multiple categories?

Wait, the problem says \"Dogs at the school can learn to do three tricks: sit, stay, and roll over.\" So, the 9 dogs that can do none are either not learning any tricks or not proficient enough? But since the problem states \"9 dogs can do none,\" it's probably referring to the dogs that don't perform any tricks. So, the total number of dogs in the school would be the number of dogs that can perform at least one trick plus the 9 dogs that can't perform any tricks. Therefore, the formula would be:\n\nTotal dogs = (Number of dogs that can do at least one trick) + 9\n\nSo, the first step is to calculate the number of dogs that can do at least one trick using inclusion-exclusion, then add the 9 dogs that can't do any tricks.\n\nSo, let's denote the sets as follows:\n\n- S: dogs that can sit\n- T: dogs that can stay\n- R: dogs that can roll over\n\nWe are given:\n\n- |S| = 50\n- |S \u2229 T| = 17\n- |T| = 29\n- |T \u2229 R| = 12\n- |R| = 34\n- |S \u2229 R| = 18\n- |S \u2229 T \u2229 R| = 9\n\nWe need to find |S \u222a T \u222a R|, which is the number of dogs that can do at least one trick.\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets:\n\n|S \u222a T \u222a R| = |S| + |T| + |R| - |S \u2229 T| - |T \u2229 R| - |S \u2229 R| + |S \u2229 T \u2229 R|\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n= 50 + 29 + 34 - 17 - 12 - 18 + 9\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, sum of individual sets:\n\n50 + 29 = 79\n\n79 + 34 = 113\n\nSubtract the pairwise intersections:\n\n79 - 17 = 62\n\n62 - 12 = 50\n\n50 - 18 = 32\n\nAdd back the triple intersection:\n\n32 + 9 = 41\n\nTherefore, |S \u222a T \u222a R| = 41\n\nSo, the number of dogs that can perform at least one trick is 41. Adding the 9 dogs that can do none:\n\nTotal dogs = 41 + 9 = 50\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculation to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nStarting again:\n\n|S \u222a T \u222a R| = |S| + |T| + |R| - |S \u2229 T| - |T \u2229 R| - |S \u2229 R| + |S \u2229 T \u2229 R|\n\nSubstituting:\n\n50 + 29 + 34 = 113\n\n17 + 12 + 18 = 47\n\nSo, 113 - 47 = 66\n\nThen, 66 + 9 = 75?

It's a classic inclusion-exclusion principle question, but with three categories: sit, stay, and roll over. The goal is to find the total number of dogs in the school. To do this, I need to organize the given information and apply the formula for three overlapping sets.\n\nFirst, let me list out all the provided data:\n\n- Total sitting dogs: 50\n- Sitting and staying dogs: 17\n- Total staying dogs: 29\n- Staying and rolling over dogs: 12\n- Total rolling over dogs: 34\n- Sitting and rolling over dogs: 18\n- All three tricks (sit, stay, roll over): 9\n- Dogs that can do none: 9\n\nWe need to find the total number of dogs in the school. Let's denote the three sets as sitting (S), staying (T), and rolling over (R). The formula for the union of three sets is:\n\n|S \u222a T \u222a R| = |S| + |T| + |R| - |S \u2229 T| - |S \u2229 R| - |T \u2229 R| + |S \u2229 T \u2229 R|\n\nOnce we calculate this union, we add the dogs that can do none to get the total number of dogs in the school. Let me verify each part step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list the individual values:\n\n- |S| = 50\n- |T| = 29\n- |R| = 34\n- |S \u2229 T| = 17\n- |S \u2229 R| = 18\n- |T \u2229 R| = 12\n- |S \u2229 T \u2229 R| = 9\n\nNow, plug these into the inclusion-exclusion formula:\n\n|S \u222a T \u222a R| = 50 + 29 + 34 - 17 - 18 - 12 + 9\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, add all the individual sets:\n\n50 (S) + 29 (T) + 34 (R) = 50 + 29 = 79; 79 + 34 = 113\n\nNext, subtract the pairwise intersections:\n\n113 - 17 (S \u2229 T) - 18 (S \u2229 R) - 12 (T \u2229 R) = 113 - 17 = 96; 96 - 18 = 78; 78 - 12 = 66\n\nThen add back the three-way intersection:\n\n66 + 9 (S \u2229 T \u2229 R) = 75\n\nSo, |S \u222a T \u222a R| = 75. That means there are 75 dogs that can perform at least one of the three tricks. Then, adding the 9 dogs that can do none gives the total number of dogs in the school: 75 + 9 = 84.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a calculation error somewhere.\n\nStarting again:\n\n1. Total sitting and staying: 17\n\n2. Sitting and rolling over: 18\n\n3. Staying and rolling over: 12\n\n4. All three: 9\n\nSo when adding pairwise intersections, we subtracting the all three to avoid double-counting. Then adding back the all three because we subtracted it three times in the pairwise intersections. Then the pairwise intersections are already double-counted.\n\nWait, actually, let me re-examine the inclusion-exclusion formula steps:\n\nThe formula is |A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \u2229 B| - |A \u2229 C| - |B \u2229 C| + |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n50 + 29 + 34 = 113\n\nSubtracting the pairwise intersections:\n\n113 - 17 - 18 - 12 = 50\n\nBut then, how do the pairwise intersections overlap? Let me see:\n\nEach of the pairwise intersections (S \u2229 T, S \u2229 R, T \u2229 R) includes those three intersections once each. For example, |S \u2229 T| is 17, which includes the people who do both sit and stay, sit and roll over, and all three.\n\nTherefore, when we subtract |S \u2229 T|, |S \u2229 R|, |T \u2229 R|, we have overcounted the people who do all three thrice.

Let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, let me summarize the given data presented in the table:\n\n- 50 dogs can sit.\n- 17 dogs can sit and stay.\n- 29 dogs can stay.\n- 12 dogs can stay and roll over.\n- 34 dogs can roll over.\n- 18 dogs can sit and roll over.\n- 9 dogs can do all three tricks.\n- 9 dogs can do none of the tricks.\n\nI need to find the total number of dogs in the school. Hmm. This seems like a problem that involves using the principle of inclusion-exclusion for three sets, since we're dealing with dogs that can perform combinations of tricks. Let me recall how inclusion-exclusion works for three sets. \n\nThe formula for the number of elements in the union of three sets A, B, and C is:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \u2229 B| - |A \u2229 C| - |B \u2229 C| + |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|\n\nBut in this problem, we might need to be careful because some dogs can do multiple tricks. The key here is to make sure that we count each dog only once, even if they can do multiple tricks. So, the total number of dogs here would be the union of all dogs who can perform each combination of tricks. \n\nHowever, the problem mentions that 9 dogs can do none of the tricks. So, we have to adjust for that. Normally, inclusion-exclusion counts dogs in exactly one set, but if we want to count all dogs including those who don't do any tricks, we have to add them in. But wait, the trick is that the table gives numbers for dogs that can do specific combinations but not all. So perhaps it's a bit different. Let me check.\n\nFirst, let me list the given numbers:\n\n- |A| = 50 (dogs that can sit)\n- |B| = 29 (dogs that can stay)\n- |C| = 34 (dogs that can roll over)\n- |A \u2229 B| = 17 (can sit and stay)\n- |A \u2229 C| = 18 (can sit and roll over)\n- |B \u2229 C| = 12 (can stay and roll over)\n- |A \u2229 B \u2229 C| = 9 (can do all three)\n\nBut wait, are these all the possible intersections? The problem mentions \"9 dogs can do all three\" and other combinations like \"17 dogs can sit and stay\", \"12 dogs can stay and roll over\", etc. So, those might represent the pairwise intersections. But to be thorough, are there any dogs that can only do one trick? For example, dogs that can only sit, only stay, only roll over, or maybe some dogs might not be able to perform any tricks. Wait, the problem says 9 dogs can do none of the tricks. So, 9 are excluded from all three sets. Then, the rest are covered by the intersections and the \"all three\" group.\n\nBut the inclusion-exclusion formula would account for overlapping dogs. So, if we use inclusion-exclusion, the total number of dogs that can perform at least one trick would be |A \u222a B \u222a C|. Then, adding the 9 dogs that can do none, gives the total school population. But wait, hold on. Let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, when the problem says \"dogs at the school: 9 dogs can do none of the tricks.\" So, 9 dogs have zero tricks, and the rest are in some combination of the three tricks. Therefore, to find the total number of dogs in the school, we need to take the number of dogs that can do at least one trick (which is some number, let's call it N), and then add the 9 dogs that don't do any tricks. So, total dogs = N + 9. \n\nBut N is the number of dogs that can be assigned at least one trick. To compute N, we can use inclusion-exclusion for three sets. Let me recall the formula again:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \u2229 B| - |A \u2229 C| - |B \u2229 C| + |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = 50 + 29 + 34 - 17 - 18 - 12 + 9\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, add", 0.47999998927116394], ["25", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

So, we have this problem where dogs can do three tricks: sit, stay, and roll over. And there are some numbers given about dogs that can do combinations of these tricks. Also, there are 9 dogs that can do none of the tricks. We need to find the total number of dogs in the school. Hmm, this sounds like a classic inclusion-exclusion problem. Let me recall how that works.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion principle helps us find the total number of elements in three sets by adding the sizes of the individual sets, subtracting the sizes of their pairwise intersections, and then adding back the size of the triple intersection. The formula is:\n\nTotal = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\nWhere |A| is the number of dogs that can sit, |B| are those that can stay, |C| are those that can roll over. Then, the intersections like |A\u2229B| are dogs that can both sit and stay, etc. But we also have the total number of dogs, which includes those that can do none (9 dogs). So, maybe we can adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nWait, the problem says there are 50 dogs that can sit, 29 that can stay, and 34 that can roll over. Then, there are dogs that can do combinations of these tricks with some overlaps. For example, 17 can sit and stay, 12 can stay and roll over, 18 can sit and roll over. And 9 dogs can do all three. So, maybe the total number of dogs that can do any of the tricks is the sum of each individual group minus the overlaps, plus the triple overlap.\n\nBut let me check. The inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets would be:\n\nTotal usable = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal usable = 50 + 29 + 34 - 17 - 12 - 18 + 9\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, add all the individual sets: 50 + 29 + 34. Let's see, 50 + 29 is 79, and 79 + 34 is 113.\n\nThen subtract the pairwise intersections: 17 + 12 + 18. That's 17 + 12 = 29, then 29 + 18 = 47.\n\nSo, 113 - 47 = 66.\n\nThen add the triple intersection: 66 + 9 = 75.\n\nSo, total dogs that can perform at least one trick are 75. But there are 9 dogs that can do none. So, the total number of dogs would be those 75 plus the 9, which is 75 + 9 = 84.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me verify each step.\n\nFirst, adding the individual groups:\n\n50 (sit) + 29 (stay) = 79\n\n79 + 34 (roll over) = 113. That seems correct.\n\nThen, subtract the pairwise intersections:\n\n17 (sit & stay) + 12 (stay & roll over) + 18 (sit & roll over) = 17 + 12 = 29, 29 + 18 = 47. Then 113 - 47 is indeed 66.\n\nThen adding the triple intersection: 66 + 9 = 75. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number is 75 + 9 = 84.\n\nBut hold on, the problem says there are 9 dogs that can do none. But is that all? The problem doesn't mention anything about dogs that can do two tricks or three tricks. So, the calculation should assume that the 9 dogs are the only ones who can't perform any tricks. So, yes, 75 dogs can perform at least one trick, and adding the 9 gives the total of 84.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check this with another approach. Let's see, if each dog can do 0, 1, 2, or 3 tricks, and we have to find the total.

This sounds like a problem where we can use something called the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Yeah, that might be the way to go here. Let me recall. \n\nFirst, inclusion-exclusion is used when we need to find the total number of elements in a union of multiple sets. So, in this case, we have three sets: dogs that can sit (S), dogs that can stay (T), and dogs that can roll over (R). We need to find the union of these three sets, which would give us all the dogs that can perform at least one trick. Then, since there are also 9 dogs who can do none of the tricks, we can add those 9 to the union to get the total number of dogs in the school. \n\nLet me write down the given information first to make sure I have all the numbers right. \n\nFrom the table:\n\n- \\( |S| = 50 \\) (dogs can sit)\n- \\( |T| = 29 \\) (dogs can stay)\n- \\( |R| = 34 \\) (dogs can roll over)\n- The intersections:\n  - \\( |S \\cap T| = 17 \\) (dogs can sit and stay)\n  - \\( |T \\cap R| = 12 \\) (dogs can stay and roll over)\n  - \\( |S \\cap R| = 18 \\) (dogs can sit and roll over)\n  - \\( |S \\cap T \\cap R| = 9 \\) (dogs can do all three)\n  - \\( |N| = 9 \\) (dogs can do none)\n\nSo, the total number of dogs that can do at least one trick is \\( |S \\cup T \\cup R| \\).

What was the height of the tree, in feet, at the end of 3 years?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "<think>\nOkay, so there's this problem about a tree that doubles its height every year, and it reaches 32 feet at the end of 6 years. The question is asking how tall the tree was at the end of 3 years. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem mentions that the tree doubles its height every year. That means each year, the height is multiplied by 2. And we know that after 6 years, the tree is 32 feet tall. Hmm, we need to find its height after 3 years. \n\nLet me approach this by working backwards. If I know the height at year 6, then I can divide by 2 each year going back to find the height at previous years. Since doubling back each year would mean dividing by 2 each time. Let me write that out.\n\nAt year 6: 32 feet\n\nTo find the year 5: 32 feet divided by 2 is 16 feet.\n\nYear 4: 16 feet divided by 2 is 8 feet.\n\nYear 3: 8 feet divided by 2 is 4 feet.\n\nYear 2: 4 feet divided by 2 is 2 feet.\n\nYear 1: 2 feet divided by 2 is 1 foot.\n\nYes, that seems right. So each year, we go back 32 divided by 2 three times. Let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from 6 years: 32. \n\n6 years: 32\n\n5 years: 32 / 2 = 16\n\n4 years: 16 / 2 = 8\n\n3 years: 8 / 2 = 4\n\n2 years: 4 / 2 = 2\n\n1 year: 2 / 2 = 1\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the tree was 4 feet tall at the end of 3 years. \n\nBut let me verify another way. Maybe using exponential growth. The height can be modeled by an exponential function: h(t) = h0 * 2^t, where t is the number of years. We know that at t = 6, h(6) = 32. So we can solve for h0 (the initial height) and then find h(3).\n\nLet's solve for h0:\n\n32 = h0 * 2^6\n\nSo h0 = 32 / 2^6\n\nCalculate 2^6: 64. So h0 = 32 / 64 = 0.5 feet.\n\nWait, that's interesting. The initial height was 0.5 feet. So the tree was tiny at the beginning, but then doubled each year. Hmm, but the question is asking for the height at year 3. Let's use the same formula.\n\nh(3) = 0.5 * 2^3 = 0.5 * 8 = 4 feet. Yep, same result as before. So that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, if I don't go back step by step, I can use logarithms.

What was the height of the tree, in feet, at the end of 3 years?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem here about a tree that doubles its height every year. At the end of 6 years, it's 32 feet tall. The question is asking how tall it was at the end of 3 years. Hmm, let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, let me parse the problem. The tree doubles its height each year. So, if at the end of year 6 it's 32 feet, then one year before that, at year 5, it would have been half the height. Similarly, at year 4, it would have been half of year 5, and so on, all the way back to year 3. So, since we need to go 3 years back from year 6, that should give us the height at year 3.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me work it out step by step. Let me call the height at the end of year n as H(n). According to the problem, H(6) = 32 feet. And each year, the tree doubles its height. So, H(5) = H(6)/2 = 32/2 = 16 feet. Similarly, H(4) = H(5)/2 = 16/2 = 8 feet. Then H(3) = H(4)/2 = 8/2 = 4 feet. So, at the end of year 3, the tree was 4 feet tall.\n\nBut let me verify this logic. If the tree is doubling every year, then H(n) = H(n-1) * 2. So, working backwards from H(6) = 32, to find H(3), we need to divide by 2 each year. Let's check:\n\nH(6) = 32\n\nH(5) = H(6)/2 = 16\n\nH(4) = H(5)/2 = 8\n\nH(3) = H(4)/2 = 4\n\nYep, that seems to check out. So, the height at the end of year 3 is 4 feet. Therefore, the answer should be 4.\n\nWait, but maybe I should approach it differently. Let's think recursively. Let me define H(n) as the height at the end of year n. Then, since it doubles every year, H(n) = 2 * H(n-1). But we need to find H(3) given H(6) = 32.\n\nSince H(6) = H(5)*2, so H(5) = H(6)/2 = 16.\n\nSimilarly, H(4) = H(5)/2 = 8, and H(3) = H(4)/2 = 4. So yes, same answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using exponents. Since the height is doubling each year, the height after t years is H(t) = H(0) * 2^t. But we don't know the initial height. However, if we consider the time difference from year 3 to year 6, that's 3 years. So, H(6) = H(3) * 2^(6-3) = H(3) * 8. Since H(6) = 32, then H(3) = 32 / 8 = 4. Perfect, that's another way to look at it, using the doubling each year.\n\nSo regardless of the method, the answer is 4 feet at the end of year 3. I think that's solid. Let me just check once more.\n\nYear 6: 32 feet\n\nYear 5: 32 / 2 = 16\n\nYear 4: 16 / 2 = 8\n\nYear 3: 8 / 2 = 4\n\nYes, that's 4. So, seems correct. I don't see any errors here.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe height of the tree at the end of 3 years is \\boxed{4} feet.\n</think>\n\nThe tree doubles its height every year and is 32 feet tall at the end of 6 years.

What was the height of the tree, in feet, at the end of 3 years?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this tree problem. So, the tree doubled its height every year, and by the end of the 6th year, it was 32 feet tall. The question is asking for the height of the tree at the end of the 3rd year. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, since the tree doubles its height each year, this is a doubling effect over consecutive years. That sounds like a geometric progression, right? Each term is the previous term multiplied by 2. So, if I can figure out the height at the end of the 1st year, then 2nd, etc., up to the 6th, which is given as 32 feet, I can work backward to find the height at the 3rd year.\n\nLet me denote the height of the tree at the end of the nth year as H(n). According to the problem, H(6) = 32 feet. Since each year the tree doubles its height, H(n) = H(n-1) * 2. Therefore, working backward from the 6th year, I can find each previous year's height.\n\nSo starting from the 6th year:\nH(6) = 32 feet\n\nTo find H(5), since it's doubled from the previous year:\nH(5) = H(6) / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16 feet\n\nThen H(4) = H(5) / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8 feet\n\nH(3) = H(4) / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4 feet\n\nH(2) = H(3) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2 feet\n\nH(1) = H(2) / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1 foot\n\nSo, according to this calculation, the height at the end of the 3rd year is 4 feet. Let me check this again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nIf H(6) is 32, then half of that is 16, which is H(5). Half of 16 is 8, which is H(4). Half of 8 is 4, which is H(3). Yes, that seems right. Each time, dividing by 2, so 16 / 2 is 8, then 8 / 2 is 4. Yep, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could model this as a geometric sequence where the first term is H(1) and the common ratio is 2. The nth term of a geometric sequence is given by H(n) = H(1) * 2^(n-1). But perhaps that's complicating it. Let me try that way to verify.\n\nIf H(6) = H(1) * 2^(6-1) = H(1) * 2^5 = H(1) * 32. We know that this equals 32 feet, so H(1) * 32 = 32. Dividing both sides by 32 gives H(1) = 1 foot. So the first year's height is 1 foot. Then, H(2) = 1 * 2 = 2 feet, H(3) = 2 * 2 = 4 feet, H(4) = 4 * 2 = 8 feet, H(5) = 8 * 2 = 16 feet, H(6) = 16 * 2 = 32 feet. Perfect, that matches.\n\nTherefore, the height at the end of the 3rd year is 4 feet. I think that's the answer. Let me just check once more to make sure I haven't miscalculated any steps.\n\nStarting from 32 in year 6:\n32 / 2 = 16 (year 5)\n16 / 2 = 8 (year 4)\n8 / 2 = 4 (year 3)\nYes, that's correct. Each time, halving the height. So after three years, it's 4 feet. All the steps check out. No mistakes detected.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe height of the tree at the end of the 3rd year is \\boxed{4} feet.\n</think>\n\nThe tree's height doubles every year.

The problem says that the tree doubled its height every year, and it reached 32 feet at the end of 6 years. Hmm, so it's doubling each year, right?\n\nFirst, let me break down what happens each year. Starting from some initial height, year one it doubles, then year two, and so on up to year six. At the end of year six, the height is 32 feet. So, if I can go backward from year six to year three, maybe that will help? Because maybe working backward from the known data point would be easier. Let me think.\n\nIf the tree doubles in height each year, then each previous year, it must have been half as tall as the next year. So, if I want to find the height at year three, I need to find the height at year four and then divide by two, and then do the same for year five and six. Is that right?\n\nLet me verify. For example, if at year six it's 32, then year five must be half of that, which is 16. Then, year four would be half of year five's height, so 8. Similarly, year three would be 4. That seems to make sense because each previous year's height is half of the next one. So, yeah, if at year six it's 32, then working forward would multiply each year's height by 2, and backward by dividing by 2.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me test this with a smaller number to see if the logic holds. Let's say the tree was 1 foot tall at year six. Then year five would be 0.5 feet, year four would be 0.25 feet, and year three would be 0.125 feet. If I go forward from year six, multiplying each year's height by 2 each time, I get 2, 4, 8, 16, 32. Yes, that works. So if I go backward, starting from 32 at year six, dividing by 2 each year gives 16, 8, 4. So, at year three, it was 4 feet. That seems consistent.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using exponents. Since the tree doubles each year, the height can be represented as 2^n where n is the number of years since the first doubling. Wait, but need to define the starting point.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to set up the equation. Let\u2019s denote the height at the end of year X as H(X). The tree doubles each year, so H(X) = 2 * H(X - 1). But this is the same as saying H(X) = 2 * H(X - 1). Wait, but if we take natural logs, taking the logarithm of both sides would give log(H(X)) = log(2) + log(H(X - 1)). So, this is a linear relationship in log scale. So, if we let y = log(H(X)), then y = log(2) + y(X - 1). So, y(X) = y(X - 1) + log(2). That's a simple linear recurrence relation. Therefore, the function H(X) is an exponential function: H(X) = H(0) * 2^X, where X is the number of years since the first measurement.\n\nBut since the problem gives the height at year 6, we can use that to find H(0). Let's denote H(0) as the height at the start, or at year 0 if we consider year 0 as year 0. Wait, maybe it's better to express H(X) as the initial height (at year 0) multiplied by 2^X. But in the problem, we don't know the initial height. However, since each year's height is double the previous year's, the height at year 6 can be written as 2^6 times the initial height. So, H(6) = H(0) * 2^6. Therefore, H(0) = H(6) / 2^6. Therefore, H(3) = H(0) * 2^3 = (H(6)/2^6) * 2^3 = H(6)/2^(6 - 3) = H(6)/2^3. So, H(3) = H(6)/8.\n\nTherefore, since H(6) is 32, H(3) = 32 / 8 = 4. So that's the same answer as before. Therefore, the height at year three is 4 feet.\n\nLet me check with another method.

So, the question is about a tree that doubles its height every year. At the end of 6 years, it's 32 feet tall. I need to find out how tall it was at the end of 3 years. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that if something doubles its height each year, it's an exponential growth problem. So, every year, the height is multiplied by 2. That means the height in year n can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHeight after n years = Initial height \u00d7 2^n\n\nBut wait, we don't know the initial height. Instead, we know the height at year 6 is 32 feet. So maybe I can work backwards from year 6 to year 3? That makes sense because if the tree doubles each year, then going back in time would divide the height by 2 each year.\n\nLet me write that down. Let\u2019s denote:\n\nHeight at year 6: 32 feet\n\nHeight at year 5: 32 / 2 = 16 feet\n\nHeight at year 4: 16 / 2 = 8 feet\n\nHeight at year 3: 8 / 2 = 4 feet\n\nHmm, so that seems right if I work backwards. Each year before, the height is half of the next year's height. So every year before the 6th year, the height would be half of 32, which is 16, then 8, then 4. That would mean 4 feet at the end of 3 years.\n\nBut wait, let me verify this with the formula. If we start with the height at year n and work backwards using the formula:\n\nHeight at year n = Current_height \u00d7 (1/2)^(n - 6)\n\nBut since we are going back from year 6 to year 3, that would be using n = 3:\n\nHeight at year 3 = 32 \u00d7 (1/2)^(3 - 6) = 32 \u00d7 (1/2)^(-3) = 32 \u00d7 8 = 256\n\nWait, that's a different number. Hmm. So there's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nHold on, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me double-check.\n\nIf the tree doubles each year, then:\n\nHeight at year 6 = Height at year 5 \u00d7 2\n\nHeight at year 5 = Height at year 4 \u00d7 2\n\nand so on up to year 1 = Height at year 0 \u00d7 2\n\nBut since we don't know the initial height, maybe we can express the height at year n as:\n\nHeight at year n = Height at year 0 \u00d7 2^n\n\nBut at year 6, Height = 32 feet, so:\n\n32 = Height at 0 \u00d7 2^6\n\nTherefore, Height at 0 = 32 / 2^6 = 32 / 64 = 0.5 feet\n\nBut that seems really small. If the tree started at 0.5 feet and doubled every year, by year 6 it would be 0.5 \u00d7 2^6 = 0.5 \u00d7 64 = 32 feet. So that works.\n\nTherefore, the height at year 3 would be:\n\n32 / 2^3 = 32 / 8 = 4 feet.\n\nSo the answer should be 4 feet.\n\nAlternatively, working backwards from year 6:\n\nYear 6: 32\n\nYear 5: 16\n\nYear 4: 8\n\nYear 3: 4\n\nEither way, the height at year 3 is 4 feet. So, the answer is 4.\n\nLet me just make sure there isn't another interpretation. The problem says \"at the end of 6 years\". If the tree was planted at some time before year 1, but the problem doesn't mention when it was planted. It just mentions doubling each year until it reaches 32 at year 6. So I think the problem is simply leading us to work backwards from year 6 to year 3 by halving each year, which is the correct approach.\n\nTherefore, the height at year 3 is 4 feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe height of the tree at the end of 3 years was \\boxed{4} feet.\n</think>\n\nThe tree doubles its height every year.

So, the problem says a tree doubled its height every year until it reached 32 feet at the end of 6 years. We need to find out its height at the end of 3 years. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the tree's growth is doubling each year. That means the growth is exponential. Starting from a certain height, each year it gets twice as tall. The final height after 6 years is 32 feet. We need to work backwards to find the height at 3 years. Maybe starting from 6 years and halving each year until we reach 3 years?\n\nLet me explain. If after 6 years the tree is 32 feet, then one year before that, at the end of year 5, it must have been 32 / 2 = 16 feet. Then, at the end of year 4, it would have been 16 / 2 = 8 feet. Continuing this backward, at the end of year 3, it would be 8 / 2 = 4 feet. So, is that right?\n\nWait, let me check. Let's assign variables to each year to verify. Let\u2019s say at the end of year n, the height is H(n). Since the tree doubles each year, H(n) = H(n-1) * 2. Therefore, H(n-1) = H(n) / 2.\n\nGiven H(6) = 32 feet. Therefore, H(5) = 32 / 2 = 16 feet.\n\nSimilarly, H(4) = 16 / 2 = 8 feet.\n\nH(3) = 8 / 2 = 4 feet.\n\nH(2) = 4 / 2 = 2 feet.\n\nH(1) = 2 / 2 = 1 foot.\n\nH(0), which would be the initial height at year 0, is 1 / 2 = 0.5 feet.\n\nSo, starting from the end of 6 years (32 feet), going back one year gives 16 feet, then 8, then 4 at the end of year 3. That seems correct.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps. The problem says it reached 32 feet at the end of 6 years. So 6 years of doubling. So each year is a doubling. So year 6: 32. Year 5: 16. Year 4: 8. Year 3: 4. Year 2: 2. Year 1: 1. Year 0: 0.5. So yes, at the end of 3 years, it's 4 feet. I think that's the answer. Let me just visualize this:\n\nYear 0: 0.5 ft\n\nYear 1: 1.0 ft (0.5 * 2)\n\nYear 2: 2.0 ft (1.0 * 2)\n\nYear 3: 4.0 ft (2.0 * 2)\n\nYear 4: 8.0 ft (4.0 * 2)\n\nYear 5: 16.0 ft (8.0 * 2)\n\nYear 6: 32.0 ft (16.0 * 2)\n\nYes, that's a geometric progression with a common ratio of 2. So each subsequent year's height is double the previous one. Therefore, subtracting 3 years backwards, starting from 32, divide by 2 three times. Each division by 2 gives us the previous year's height. So 32 divided by 2 is 16, divided by 2 again is 8, divided by 2 once more is 4. So that's 3 years ago, it was 4 feet.\n\nAlternatively, using exponents: After 6 years, the height is 32 = 2^6. Wait, let's check that. 2^6 is 64. But here it's 32. Hmm, so maybe that's not the right approach. Wait, perhaps there's a different way to model this? Let me check.\n\nIf the tree's height is doubling each year, then the height at year n can be expressed as H(n) = H(0) * 2^n. So if H(6) = 32, then H(0) = 32 / 2^6 = 32 / 64 = 0.5. Then, H(3) = 0.5 * 2^3 = 0.5 * 8 = 4.

Hmm, so we need to reverse-engineer this because if we start from the end and work backwards, that might be easier. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, the tree is 32 feet tall at the end of year 6. Since it doubled its height every year, the previous year, which would be year 5, would have been half the height it was at year 6. Let me write that out. If h6 = 32, then h5 = h6 / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16 feet. So at the end of year 5, the tree was 16 feet tall.\n\nContinuing this logic, at the end of year 4, the height would be h5 / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8 feet.

So perhaps we need to calculate the height at the end of year 3 by going backward.\n\nSo reverse-engineering:\n\nEnd of year 6: 32 feet.\n\nEnd of year 5: 32 / 2 = 16.\n\nEnd of year 4: 16 / 2 = 8.\n\nEnd of year 3: 8 / 2 = 4.\n\nSo that's 4 feet at year 3. So maybe the answer is 4 feet. Let me check again by going forward:\n\nStart with year 6: 32.\n\nYear 5: 32 / 2 = 16.\n\nYear 4: 16 / 2 = 8.\n\nYear 3: 8 / 2 = 4.\n\nYear 2: 4 / 2 = 2.\n\nYear 1: 2 / 2 = 1.\n\nYear 0: 1 / 2 = 0.5.\n\nBut maybe the duration is in years starting from the beginning. The problem says \"until it reached 32 feet at the end of 6 years.\" So from the start, 6 years. But maybe the height is at the start of the period? Hmm, maybe the starting height is 0.5 feet. But if we are to find the height at the end of 3 years, regardless of duration, I think 4 feet is correct. Let me check again.\n\nIf the height is doubling each year, then each year's height is previous year's height multiplied by 2. So starting with some initial height, after 6 years it's 32 feet. So the formula is H = initial height * 2^6 = 32. Therefore, initial height = 32 / 2^6 = 32 / 64 = 0.5 feet. Then, after 3 years, H = 0.5 * 2^3 = 0.5 *", 0.5299999713897705], ["25", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

The question is asking for the sum of the values of x that are not solutions. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nThe equation is given as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(x+B)(Ax+28)}{(x+C)(x+7)} = 2\n\\]\n\nAnd we need to figure out constants A, B, and C such that this equation has infinitely many solutions. Wait, usually if an equation has infinitely many solutions, that means it's an identity, like 0=0, which is always true. But here, the equation is a rational equation. For such equations to be identities, the numerator must be a scalar multiple of the denominator. Let me recall, if two rational expressions are equal for all x in their domain (except possibly at the excluded points C and x = -7, etc.), then their numerators must be proportional to their denominators with the same scalar. So if this equation holds for infinitely many x, then (x+B)(Ax + 28) must be equal to 2*(x+C)(x+7) for all x except at the excluded points. That would mean that the two polynomials are identical, so their coefficients must be equal.\n\nWait, but let me check that. Let's suppose that the equation:\n\n\\[\n(x+B)(Ax + 28) = 2(x + C)(x + 7)\n\\]\n\nholds for infinitely many x. For this to be true for all x in the domain (i.e., excluding x = -C and x = -7, unless those are excluded due to the denominator? Wait, actually, x = -C and x = -7 are the points where the original equation is undefined. So for the equation to hold for all x except x = -C and x = -7, but the problem says \"infinitely many solutions,\" so that suggests that these excluded points are just not in the domain. But if the equation is supposed to hold for all x except those two, but the problem states that even though it's supposed to have infinitely many solutions, they do not want me to count those two. Wait, maybe the problem is phrased a bit differently.\n\nWait, let me reread the problem:\n\n\"It turns out that there are only finitely many values of x which are not solutions to the equation. Find the sum of these values of x.\"\n\nAh! So the problem states that even though the equation is supposed to have infinitely many solutions (if it's an identity), but due to the domain restrictions (i.e., the exclusion of certain x values), the set of solutions is indeed infinitely many but excluding finitely many x. Wait, but if the equation is an identity, then there are infinitely many x satisfying it. But the problem says \"only finitely many values of x which are not solutions.\" Wait, perhaps there's a mistranslation or something? Let me parse the problem again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"It turns out that there are only finitely many values of x which are not solutions to the equation. Find the sum of these values of x.\"\n\nPerhaps the problem is saying that the equation is not an identity, but instead it's an identity for all but finitely many x, hence only finitely many values not being solutions. So in other words, if the equation is false only at finitely many points, then those points are not solutions. So the problem is phrased as \"the equation has only finitely many solutions... Find the sum of these finitely many x's.\"\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the equation is an identity except for finitely many x, so those x's are solutions, and the others are not solutions.\n\nTherefore, if the equation is not an identity, then there is a finite number of x where the equation is false, and thus those x's are not solutions, and we need to find the sum of those x's.\n\nSo, to solve this, we need to first determine the values of A, B, C such that the equation is not an identity. Then, find all x that make the equation false, and sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's try to determine A, B, C such that the equation is not an identity. Let's start by equating the numerators and denominators, as that is when two rational expressions are equal for all x.\n\nSo, if:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(x+B)(Ax + 28)}{(x+C)(x+7)} = 2\n\\]\n\nfor all x except x = -C and x = -7 (since the denominator isn't zero).

But then, they mention that there are only finitely many values of x that aren't solutions. We need to find the sum of these values of x. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, if the equation has infinitely many solutions, that usually means that the numerator is a multiple of the denominator. In other words, the equation (x + B)(Ax + 28) - 2(x + C)(x + 7) = 0 must be an identity, which means it's valid for all x except where the denominator is zero. Wait, but if the original equation is equal to 2, then the numerator must equal 2 times the denominator. So actually, this equation can only hold for x where the denominator isn't zero. But if there are infinitely many solutions, that would suggest that the numerator and denominator are scalar multiples of each other. Let me verify that.\n\nLet's set up the equation:\n\n(x + B)(Ax + 28) = 2(x + C)(x + 7)\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side: Ax\u00b2 + (A B + 28)x + 28 B\n\nRight side: 2x\u00b2 + 2(C + 7)x + 14 C\n\nSo, bringing everything to one side:\n\nAx\u00b2 + (A B + 28)x + 28 B - 2x\u00b2 - 2(C + 7)x - 14 C = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n[(A - 2)x\u00b2] + [(A B + 28 - 2C - 14)x] + [28 B - 14 C] = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(A - 2)x\u00b2 + [(A B + 14 - 2C)x] + [28 B - 14 C] = 0\n\nSince this equation must hold for infinitely many x, the coefficients of all powers of x must be zero.

First, note that (x + 7) is a common factor in the numerator and denominator. However, we have to make sure that x \u2260 -7 because that would make the denominator zero.

Then it says that for these values of A, B, and C, there are only finitely many values of x which are not solutions to the equation, and I need to find the sum of these values of x.\n\nFirst, let me recall that when a rational equation has infinitely many solutions, that means the numerator and the denominator are proportional to each other. So essentially, the equation ((x + B)(Ax + 28)) = 2*(x + C)(x + 7) must hold true for infinitely many x. How can this happen? If the two polynomials have the same roots (or coincide as polynomials), then they can be equal for infinitely many x (if they are identical). That makes sense. So, the numerator and denominator must be scalar multiples of each other. Therefore, I can set up the equation (x + B)(Ax + 28) = 2(x + C)(x + 7) and find the conditions on A, B, C such that this holds for infinitely many x. \n\nLet me work that out. First, expand both sides:\n\nLeft-hand side (LHS): (x + B)(Ax + 28) = A x^2 + (B + 28) x + 28B\n\nRight-hand side (RHS): 2(x + C)(x + 7) = 2(x^2 + (C + 7)x + 7C) = 2x^2 + 2(C + 7)x + 14C\n\nSo, setting LHS = RHS:\n\nA x^2 + (B + 28) x + 28B = 2x^2 + 2(C + 7)x + 14C\n\nFor these two quadratics to be identical for all x, their coefficients must be equal.

Constant term: 28B = 14C\n\nSo, we have three equations:\n\nA = 2\n\nB + 28 = 2C + 14\n\n28B = 14C\n\nLet me check if these equations are consistent. Let's substitute A first. Since A = 2, that's straightforward. Now, let's look at the second and third equations.\n\nFrom the first equation, A = 2. The second equation is B + 28 = 2C + 14. Let's rearrange that: B + 28 = 2C + 14 \u2192 B = 2C - 14.\n\nThe third equation is 28B = 14C. Let's rearrange that: 28B = 14C \u2192 2B = C. So, C = 2B.\n\nSo now, substituting C = 2B into the equation B = 2C - 14:\n\nB = 2*(2B) - 14 \u2192 B = 4B - 14 \u2192 -3B = -14 \u2192 B = 14/3.\n\nThen, since C = 2B, substituting B = 14/3 gives C = 2*(14/3) = 28/3.\n\nSo, the constants are A = 2, B = 14/3, and C = 28/3.\n\nWait, let me verify these values to check if they satisfy all equations.\n\nFirst equation: A = 2 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSecond equation: B + 28 = 14/3 + 28 = 14/3 + 84/3 = 98/3.

Find the sum of these values of $x.$<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The problem says that for constants A, B, and C, the equation \\(\\frac{(x+B)(Ax+28)}{(x+C)(x+7)} = 2\\) has infinitely many solutions for x. Then, it mentions that there are only finitely many values of x which are not solutions to the equation. We need to find the sum of these values of x.\n\nFirst, let me recall that if an equation involving rational functions has infinitely many solutions, it usually means that after simplifying (if possible), the remaining equation is an identity, i.e., it holds for all x (except the excluded values). However, in this case, the equation is given to have infinitely many solutions, which implies that the equation simplifies to an identity after cancellation, provided that the excluded values (denominator zeros) don't coincide with other restrictions. But wait, the problem states that the equation indeed has infinitely many solutions. That usually happens when the equation simplifies to an identity, meaning the numerator and denominator have a common factor, but the equation is undefined at some points. Wait, maybe I need to check.\n\nWait, actually, if the equation is \\(\\frac{N(x)}{D(x)} = 2\\), then the solutions are the solutions of N(x) = 2D(x). If this equation simplifies to an identity, like N(x) = D(x) always after some cancellation, then it would have infinitely many solutions. But in the problem, it says \"infinitely many solutions for x\". But x being a solution would mean that for those x, the original equation holds. So if N(x) = 2D(x) simplifies to N(x)/D(x) = 2, but after cancellation, it reduces to an identity, then the equation would have infinitely many solutions. However, the problem states that there are only finitely many values of x which are not solutions. That suggests that in the original equation, certain values where D(x) = 0 make the expression undefined, but the left-hand side is undefined at those points. But if after cancellation, the expression is 2 everywhere except those points, but the equation still requires the original left-hand side to equal 2, so those points must be excluded.\n\nWait, maybe I need to go back. Let me parse the problem again: The equation \\(\\frac{(x+B)(Ax + 28)}{(x+C)(x+7)} = 2\\) has infinitely many solutions for x. Then, among all possible x's where the left-hand side is defined, except for those x where the denominator is zero, there are only finitely many x's for which the left-hand side is not equal to 2. So the original equation is such that for x where the denominator is not zero, it's 2, but there are some x's with denominator zero where it's undefined or not defined? Wait, no. Let me check.\n\nWait, the equation is given with denominators (x + C)(x + 7). So the original equation is undefined at x = -C and x = -7. The problem states that there are only finitely many values of x which are not solutions. That means that among all x where the equation is defined (i.e., excluded by x \u2260 -C and x \u2260 -7), only finitely many x are not solutions. So the original equation is valid for x \u2260 -C and x \u2260 -7, but outside those points (i.e., x \u2260 -C and x \u2260 -7), how many x are not solutions? The problem says only finitely many, so the original equation is valid for infinitely many x, but after excluding those x = -C and x = -7, there are only finitely many x where the equation is not defined (i.e., not solutions). So the original equation is valid for infinitely many x, but when restricted to x \u2260 -C and x \u2260 -7, it's valid for infinitely many x except for finitely many points.\n\nBut the problem also says that there are infinitely many solutions for x. So this means that the equation reduces to an identity (after cancellation) except for those finitely many points where the original denominators are zero. Then, when we solve the equation, those points where the original equation is undefined (i.e., x = -C and x = -7) are considered solutions only if the equation is defined there. So the solutions are all x except x = -C and x = -7. But the problem states that there are infinitely many solutions. So how is that possible?\n\nWait, perhaps the equation \\(\\frac{(x+B)(Ax + 28)}{(x+C)(x+7)} = 2\\) simplifies to an identity after canceling common factors, except maybe for finitely many x where either numerator or", 0.4300000071525574], ["25", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

The problem says that we need to find constants A, B, and C such that the equation \\(\\frac{(x+B)(Ax+28)}{(x+C)(x+7)} = 2\\) has infinitely many solutions for x. Then, once we find those A, B, and C, we have to determine the sum of the values of x that are not solutions to the equation.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that if a rational equation has infinitely many solutions, it typically means that the equation simplifies to an identity, where both sides are exactly the same for all x except possibly some restrictions from the denominators. In this case, the equation is a rational expression set equal to 2, so if we can manipulate it so that both sides are equal for all x (except x = -C, x = -7, x = -28/A, etc., which are the excluded values due to the denominators), then the equation would have infinitely many solutions.\n\nBut wait, if the equation is an identity for infinitely many x, then the numerators must be scalar multiples of the denominators? Let's check. The original equation is \\(\\frac{(x+B)(Ax+28)}{(x+C)(x+7)} = 2\\). For this equation to hold for infinitely many x, the numerator must be equal to twice the denominator for those x. So, that would mean:\n\n\\((x+B)(Ax+28) = 2(x+C)(x+7)\\)\n\nSince this must hold for infinitely many x, except for the excluded values, so the equality must hold for all x except where denominators are zero. Therefore, the equation \\((x+B)(Ax+28) - 2(x+C)(x+7) = 0\\) must have infinitely many solutions, which would require that this expression is identically zero. Therefore, the polynomial on the left must be a zero polynomial.\n\nSo, let's expand both sides and set coefficients equal.\n\nFirst, expand the left-hand side (LHS):\n\n(x + B)(Ax + 28) = A x^2 + 28x + A B x + 28 B = A x^2 + (28 + A B) x + 28 B\n\nThen, expand the right-hand side (RHS):\n\n2(x + C)(x + 7) = 2[x^2 + (7 + C)x + 7 C] = 2x^2 + 2(7 + C)x + 14 C\n\nSet LHS equal to RHS:\n\nA x^2 + (28 + A B) x + 28 B = 2x^2 + 2(7 + C)x + 14 C\n\nSince this equation must hold for all x (except excluded values), the coefficients of corresponding powers of x must be equal. Therefore:\n\nFor x^2 terms:\nA = 2\n\nFor x terms:\n28 + A B = 2(7 + C)\n\nFor constant terms:\n28 B = 14 C\n\nSo now we have three equations:\n\n1) A = 2\n2) 28 + 2 B = 14 + 2 C\n3) 28 B = 14 C\n\nLet's solve these equations step by step.\n\nFrom equation 1: A = 2.\n\nFrom equation 3: 28 B = 14 C \u21d2 Multiply both sides by (1/14): 2 B = C. So C = 2 B.\n\nFrom equation 2: 28 + 2 B = 14 + 2 C. Substitute C = 2 B into this equation:\n\n28 + 2 B = 14 + 2*(2 B) \u21d2 28 + 2 B = 14 + 4 B \u21d2 28 - 14 = 4 B - 2 B \u21d2 14 = 2 B \u21d2 B = 7.\n\nThen, since C = 2 B, C = 2*7 = 14.\n\nSo A = 2, B = 7, C = 14.\n\nLet me check if these values satisfy the original conditions. So A = 2, B = 7, C =14. Let's substitute back into the equation:\n\nOriginal equation: \\(\\frac{(x +7)(2x +28)}{(x +14)(x +7)} = 2\\)\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: (x +7)(2x +28) = (x +7)*2(x +14) = 2(x +7)(x +14)\n\nDenominator: (x +14)(x +7)\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes: [2(x +7", 0.47999998927116394], ["25", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Let me break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, let's list out the letters in \"PROBLEM\" to get a clear picture. The word is made up of 7 letters: P, R, O, B, L, E, M. Let me note each letter with their frequencies. \n\nHere's the breakdown:\n- P: 1\n- R: 1\n- O: 1\n- B: 1\n- L: 1\n- E: 1\n- M: 1\n\nWait, all letters are unique? Let me check again. Yes, each letter is in a single word: P, R, O, B, L, E, M. Each appears once. That means we have to use all seven letters in each sequence, but the problem states \"four letters,\" so we need to use four distinct letters from the seven, with the conditions that each letter can be used only once and that the sequence must start with L and not end with P.\n\nOkay, so the problem is to count the number of four-letter sequences where:\n\n1. The sequence starts with L.\n2. The sequence does not end with P.\n3. Each letter is used exactly once (since there are seven letters total and we're choosing four).\n\nWait, but if the sequence must be four letters from the seven, and each letter can be used only once, then since there are seven letters, choosing four gives us combinations with regard to order? Wait, no. Wait, actually, permutations when selecting four letters from seven. Because each position in the sequence is specific (first, second, third, fourth), and since there are seven distinct letters, each selection of four letters can be arranged in 4! ways. But since we are choosing specifically four letters (without replacement), the number of sequences would be the number of permutations of 7 letters taken 4 at a time.\n\nBut let me confirm: the problem says \"distinct sequences of four letters\". So order matters here. So yes, the number of sequences is P(7,4) = 7*6*5*4. Let me compute that: 7*6=42, 42*5=210, 210*4=840. So 840 total possible sequences. But we need to subtract those sequences that don't start with L or don't end with P.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to compute this without getting confused with total permutations. Let me think.\n\nFirst, sequences that start with L. So the first position is fixed as L. Then, the remaining three positions need to be filled with the remaining six letters (since L is already used once). But the constraints are that the sequence cannot end with P. So the last position (fourth position) cannot be P. Therefore, in the last position, we have to choose one of the letters except P. \n\nSo, breaking it down:\n\n1. The first position is fixed as L. That leaves six remaining letters: P, O, B, R, E, M. But the last position cannot be P. So effectively, for the last position, we have five options: O, B, R, E, M.\n\nSo the number of sequences starting with L is 5*4*4. Wait, let me check that.\n\nFirst position: L. Then, third and fourth positions: from the remaining 6 letters (excluding L). The fourth position cannot be P. So from the remaining 6 letters, 5 are available (excluding L and P). Therefore, the number of sequences starting with L is indeed 5 * 4 * 4. Wait, let's see:\n\nTotal number of sequences: 5*4*4 = 80. Because the remaining three positions (after choosing L first) are filled with 5 letters (excluding L) for the third position, and for the fourth position, since we can't use P, we have 4 choices (since P is already used in the first position). Wait, no. Let me clarify step by step.\n\nTotal sequences starting with L:\n\n1. First position: L (fixed). So 1 way.\n2. Second position: Any of the remaining 6 letters (P, O, B, R, E, M). So 6 choices.\n3. Third position: Any of the remaining 5 letters (excluding the first two). But the fourth position can't be P. So in the third position, we exclude the first two letters and also exclude P.

So, the question is asking how many distinct sequences of four letters can be made from the letters in \"PROBLEM\" with the conditions that each letter can be used only once, the sequence must start with L, and it cannot end with P. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, \"PROBLEM\" has letters: P, R, O, B, L, E, M. So, 7 distinct letters. We need to form sequences of four letters, starting with L, so the first position is fixed as L. Then, the remaining three positions need to be filled with the remaining letters: P, R, O, B, E, M. Wait, but we need to make sure that the sequence doesn't end with P. So, the fourth letter cannot be P. Let me check that again. The sequence must not end with P, so the fourth position has to be one of the remaining letters except P. Wait, but the remaining letters after using L in the first position are P, R, O, B, E, M. So, excluding P, the letters available for the last position are R, O, B, E, M. That's 5 choices.\n\nBut how do we count the number of sequences? Let's think. Since the first letter is fixed (L), we need to choose and arrange the remaining three letters in the next positions. However, we have to remember that the fourth letter (last position) cannot be P.\n\nSo, the problem is equivalent to: how many 3-letter permutations from the letters P, R, O, B, E, M can be made such that the last letter is not P. Because the first letter is fixed as L, and the remaining three positions can be filled with any of the 6 letters (excluding P) but considering the permutations.\n\nWait, but actually, once we have decided the first letter as L, then the remaining letters available are 6: P, R, O, B, E, M. So, in the second position, we can choose any of these 6 letters, then the third position can choose from the remaining 5 letters (since one has been used), and the fourth position can choose from the remaining 4 letters (since two have been used), but with the restriction that the fourth isn't P. Hmm, this might complicate things. Let me approach it differently.\n\nAlternatively, since the first letter is fixed as L, we have to consider sequences of the form L _ _ _. The last letter (fourth position) cannot be P, so P is excluded for the fourth position. So, let's consider the possible letters for each position:\n\n1. First letter: L (fixed)\n2. Second letter: any of the remaining 6 letters (P, R, O, B, E, M) \u2013 6 choices\n3. Third letter: any remaining 5 letters\n4. Fourth letter: any remaining 4 letters except P (if available)\n\nBut we have to adjust if in positions 2 or 3, if we use P, which is excluded in position 4. Wait, but positions 2 and 3 can include P, as long as the fourth position doesn't. So perhaps the safest approach is to break it down based on whether positions 2 and/or 3 are P or not.\n\nBut maybe another way: the total number of 4-letter sequences starting with L is 6 * 5 * 4 = 120 (since from 6 letters, assign 2nd, 3rd, 4th). But we need to subtract the ones that end with P. So, let's compute the number of sequences where the fourth letter is P.\n\nIf fourth letter is P, then:\n\n1. First letter: L\n2. Second letter: can be any of the remaining 6 letters (P, R, O, B, E, M) \u2013 but if P was used in the second position, then P can't be used in the third or fourth. If P is used in the third position, then P could still be allowed. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think.\n\nIf the fourth letter must be P, then:\n\nPositions:\n\n1. L\n\n2. Second letter: can be any of the remaining 6 letters (including P, if allowed)\n\n3. Third letter: remaining 5 letters\n\n4. Fourth letter: P\n\nBut if in position 2 or 3, we use P, then the fourth position being P would be okay. However, if in position 2 or 3, we use P, then P is present in the sequence, but we need to ensure that the last letter is not P.

I need to figure out how many distinct sequences of four letters can be made from the letters in \"PROBLEM,\" with each letter used only once, and the sequences must begin with L and not end with P. Hmm. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the word \"PROBLEM\" has letters P, R, O, B, L, E, M. Let me count how many letters there are here. Yes, that's seven letters. So, if I need sequences of four letters, that's removing three letters from the original seven. But since we want the sequences to start with L, I need to choose the remaining three letters from the other six letters (P, R, O, B, E, M). Got it.\n\nSo, the first position must be L, so once L is fixed as the first letter, we have four positions left to fill with distinct letters from the remaining six. But there are also the condition that the sequence shouldn't end with P. So, the fourth letter can't be P. Therefore, in the final step, we have to subtract the cases where the fourth letter is P.\n\nLet me structure this. Total number of sequences starting with L, using four distinct letters from the seven in PROBLEM. Then subtract the number of sequences that both start with L and end with P.\n\nFirst, calculate total sequences starting with L. Since the first letter is fixed as L, we need to choose the next three letters from the remaining six (P, R, O, B, E, M). Since each letter must be unique, the number of permutations here is 6\u00d75\u00d74\u00d73. Let me check: first position is L (1 way), then the second position has 6 options, third position has 5, then fourth position 4. So 6\u00d75\u00d74\u00d73 = 720. So that's the total number of sequences starting with L without any restrictions.\n\nNow, subtract the number of sequences that start with L and end with P. So, in addition to the first and last letters fixed as L and P, we need to choose the middle two letters from the remaining five letters (since the letters used are L and P, so from the original seven, removes L and P, so the remaining letters are R, O, B, E, M). So, the middle two positions can be filled by any two different letters from R, O, B, E, M. \n\nLet's compute how many ways this can be done. The third position can be filled in 5 choices, and the fourth position in 4. So, 5\u00d74=20. Therefore, there are 20 sequences starting with L and ending with P.\n\nTherefore, the number of valid sequences is total sequences starting with L minus the ones that end with P: 720 - 20 = 700. So the answer should be 700. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, total sequences starting with L: 6\u00d75\u00d74\u00d73 = 360. Wait, hold on, that's different from what I calculated earlier. Wait a second, what's the difference here. When I calculated 6\u00d75\u00d74\u00d73, that's 360, but when I thought the total was 720, that was the total permutations of 6 letters taken 4 at a time, which is 6P4. Let me confirm: 6\u00d75\u00d74\u00d73 = 360. Yes, that's correct. So if the total sequences starting with L is 360, then subtract 20 from that, gives 340. Wait, but that contradicts my previous thinking. Hmm. So where did I go wrong?\n\nHold on. The original calculation was 6\u00d75\u00d74\u00d73=360, which is the number of sequences starting with L, using three more distinct letters from the remaining six. But this is 6P4, which is 6! / (6-4)! = 6\u00d75\u00d74\u00d73 = 360. So that's correct. Then subtracting the ones that end with P would be 5\u00d74\u00d73 (but since the first and last letters are L and P, but we already fixed the first letter as L and last as P. Wait, let's see. The sequences starting with L and ending with P: first is L, last is P. So middle two letters are from R, O, B, E, M. So for middle two positions, 4 letters, so 4\u00d73=12 needed?

So, the question is asking for the number of distinct sequences of four letters that can be made from the letters in \"PROBLEM.\" Each letter can be used only once in each sequence, and the sequence must start with L and not end with P. Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let me list out the letters in \"PROBLEM\" to get a clear picture. The letters are: P, R, O, B, L, E, M. Wait, that's seven letters. Yes, removes the 'E' and adds 'L'? Wait, let me check again: PROBLEM. So, P, R, O, B, L, E, M. That's seven letters total. Correct. So we have seven distinct letters, each can be used only once in a sequence of four letters.\n\nNow, the problem states that the sequences must start with L. So the first letter is fixed as L. That means we need to choose the remaining three letters from the remaining six letters (since L is already used). Also, the sequence cannot end with P. So the fourth letter cannot be P. Let me try to structure this.\n\nFirst, since the first letter is fixed as L, there's only one choice for the first position. Then, the remaining three positions need to be filled with the remaining letters, ensuring that the last letter isn't P.\n\nWait, but we have seven letters in total, and we're selecting four letters. So once L is fixed in the first position, we need to pick three more letters from the remaining six. The remaining six letters are: P, R, O, B, E, M. So the four-letter sequences will be L followed by three letters from this set, with the condition that the last letter is not P.\n\nSo the total number of sequences without the restriction of not ending with P would be the number of permutations of the remaining three letters. Let's compute that.\n\nThe remaining letters after choosing L are P, R, O, B, E, M. So if we need to choose three letters from these six, the number of permutations is 6 * 5 * 4. Let me verify: the first position can be any of the six letters, the second position any of the remaining five, third position any of the remaining four. So yes, 6 * 5 * 4 = 120. Then, when we append L to each of these, we get 120 sequences that start with L. But now, we have to subtract those sequences that end with P.\n\nSo the next step is to find the number of sequences that start with L and end with P, and then subtract that from the total 120.\n\nLet's compute the number of sequences that start with L and end with P. Since the first letter is L and the last letter is P, we need to choose the middle two letters such that L is first and P is last. So the sequence is L _ _ P. The remaining letters (after choosing L and P) are R, O, B, E, M. So we need to choose two letters from these five, arrange them in the middle positions. The number of ways is 5 * 4 = 20. Therefore, there are 20 sequences that start with L and end with P.\n\nTherefore, the total number of valid sequences is 120 (without restrictions) minus 20 (those ending with P) = 100.\n\nWait, let me check this again to be sure. Let me go through each step again.\n\nTotal permutations starting with L: Choose 3 letters from P, R, O, B, E, M. So that's 6C3 permutations. 6C3 is 20. Wait, 6C3 is 6! / (3! * 3!) = 20. Then, ordered, that's 20 sequences starting with L. But now, how many of these have P as the last letter?\n\nThe sequences starting with L and ending with P would have the structure L _ P. So, the letters between L and P are two letters. The available letters for these two positions are R, O, B, E, M. So that's 5 letters, so 5 choices for the second position and 4 for the third, which is 5 * 4 = 20. Therefore, 20 sequences start with L and end with P.\n\nTherefore, total valid sequences = 20 (total starting with L) - 20 (starting with L and ending with P) = 0? Wait, that can't be right.

The question is asking for the number of distinct sequences of four letters that can be made from the letters in \"PROBLEM\". Each sequence must begin with L and cannot end with P. Also, each letter can be used only once. Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's recall that \"PROBLEM\" has all different letters, right? Let me check. P, R, O, B, L, E, M. That's seven distinct letters. So, when forming sequences of four letters, we have to choose four different letters from these seven. Also, each sequence starts with L and doesn't end with P. That's important. So starting with L is fixed, and the last letter must not be P. Let's think.\n\nSince sequences are ordered and don't repeat letters, I guess this is a permutation problem with some constraints. Since repetition isn't allowed, once we pick a letter, it can't be used again. So, first, the first letter is fixed as L. Then, the remaining three positions can be filled with any of the remaining six letters, but with the added constraint that the last letter isn't P. Wait, no. Wait, the problem only specifies the start and the end. So the first letter is fixed as L, so that's already taken care of. Then, the remaining three positions can be filled with any of the remaining six letters, but we must ensure that the last letter is not P. So actually, the first letter is L, and then we need to pick three more letters from the remaining six (which are all except P and L). Wait, but the letters in \"PROBLEM\" are P, R, O, B, L, E, M. So excluding L, the letters are P, R, O, B, E, M. So six letters. Then after selecting the first letter (L), we have five letters left for the remaining three positions. Wait, no. Wait, the first letter is fixed as L, so that's one letter used up. Then, when selecting the second, third, and fourth letters, we have five letters left (excluding L), and we need to pick three letters from these five. However, there's a restriction: the fourth letter cannot be P. So even if we are picking three letters from the remaining five, one of them being P is not allowed as the last letter. Therefore, the total sequences would be equal to the number of ways to choose three letters from the remaining five, then arrange them in the second, third, fourth positions, but making sure that in the fourth position, it's not P.\n\nWait, let me structure this.\n\nFirst, the first letter is L. So we have already used L, so remaining letters are P, R, O, B, E, M. Six letters. Now, we need to choose three more letters from these six, arranged in the second, third, fourth positions, with the last position not being P.\n\nSo the total number of sequences would be:\n\nNumber of ways to choose three letters from the remaining five (excluding L and P) multiplied by the number of permutations of these three letters, excluding the cases where the last letter is P.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The remaining letters are P, R, O, B, E, M. Seven letters total, two of which are P and L. So excluding L and P, we have P, R, O, B, E, M. That's five letters. So when we choose three letters from these five for the second, third, fourth positions, the fourth position cannot be P. So how many options are left for the fourth position once we've chosen three letters?\n\nIf we first choose three letters from the five (P, R, O, B, E, M), then the fourth position cannot be P, so among those three letters, if P is included, we have to exclude P for the last position. If P is not included, then all three are available. So this seems like a case where inclusion-exclusion might be needed.\n\nAlternatively, we can approach this step by step:\n\n1. Fix the first letter as L.\n\n2. Select the remaining three letters from the six remaining letters (excluding L). So we have to pick three letters from P, R, O, B, E, M.\n\n3. From these selected three letters, arrange them in positions 2, 3, 4, with the constraint that the third position (if it's also selected) cannot be P.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is:\n\nSince the first letter is fixed as L, the remaining three positions can be filled with three letters from the remaining six (excluding L). However, among these six, P is one letter. So, in total, there are six possibilities for the remaining three positions.

The question is asking for the number of distinct sequences of four letters that can be made from the letters in \"PROBLEM,\" with the conditions that each letter can be used only once, each sequence must start with L and not end with P. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the word is \"PROBLEM,\" which has six distinct letters: P, R, O, B, L, E, M. Wait, hold on, let me count again. Yes, PROBLEM: P, R, O, B, L, E, M. That's seven letters? Wait, problem number seven? Let me check. Hmm, maybe \"PROBLEM\" is a problem number, but the actual letters are seven: P, R, O, B, L, E, M. Wait, that seems correct. So the letters are P, R, O, B, L, E, M. And there are seven letters total.\n\nThe problem is about sequences of four letters where each letter is used only once, starting with L and not ending with P. Let me parse that again: sequences of four letters using the letters in PROBLEM with each letter used exactly once (so it's a permutation of four letters from the seven?), starting with L, and not ending with P. So the first letter is fixed as L, so we have to choose the next three letters from the remaining six letters (since L is already used once), but they must be distinct and cannot include P if the last letter is P. Wait, no, the sequence cannot end with P. So even if we end with P, it's invalid. So the last letter must not be P. So the total sequences would be the number of permutations starting with L and not ending with P.\n\nLet me structure this step by step.\n\nFirst, since the entire sequence must be four letters long, using four distinct letters from the seven, with the first letter fixed as L. So the first position is L, so we have 1 choice for the first position. Then, the remaining three positions can be filled with the remaining six letters (P, R, O, B, E, M), but with the constraint that the last letter is not P. So after using L, we have six letters left. Let's denote the remaining letters as {P, R, O, B, E, M}.\n\nWait, but when we choose the second and third letters, we have to make sure that the fourth letter (which is the last letter) is not P. So the problem is similar to permutations of four letters where the first is fixed as L, and the last is not P.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the total number of permutations starting with L and then subtract those permutations where the last letter is P.\n\nSo, first method: total permutations starting with L, then subtract the ones that end with P.\n\nTotal permutations starting with L: Since first position is fixed as L, the remaining three positions can be any of the six remaining letters. So that's 6 choices for the second position, 5 for the third, 4 for the fourth. So total permutations = 6 * 5 * 4 = 120.\n\nNow, the ones we need to subtract are those permutations where the last letter is P. Let's compute that.\n\nIf the last letter is P, then we have to fix the last position as P. Then the first position is L, and we need to choose two more letters from the remaining five letters (since we already used P and L). But since we need to use four distinct letters, after L and P, we have four positions left, but starting with L, fixed first, then two more letters, and last one is P. Wait, but starting with L and ending with P. So the sequence is L _ _ P. The middle two letters can be any of the remaining five letters (excluding L and P). So the number of such sequences is 5 * 4 = 20. Let's check: after fixing L and P, four letters remain, so two letters can be placed in the gaps. So two choices for the second letter (from remaining five) and then two choices for the third. So 5 * 4 = 20. Therefore, subtract 20 from the total 120, giving 120 - 20 = 100.\n\nAlternatively, using the first method: total sequences starting with L: 6*5*4=120. Sequences ending with P: if we fix the last position as P, then the first position is L, second and third positions can be any of the remaining five letters. So 5*4=20. Therefore, total valid sequences: 120 - 20 = 100.\n\nBut let me confirm this with another method to ensure I didn't", 0.550000011920929], ["25", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Additionally, the first letter has to be L, and the last letter cannot be P. Got it.\n\nSo, starting with L. Since we have to use L as the first letter, we're left with the remaining letters: P, R, O, B, E, M. That's six letters left. We need to pick two more letters from these six to form the remaining three positions in the sequence.\n\nBut wait, the sequence must be four letters long, so after using L first, we have three positions left. So, the middle two positions can be filled with any combination of the remaining six letters. However, the last position cannot be P. So, in the last position, we have to exclude P if it hasn't been used yet. But since we're choosing all six letters for the last three positions, and we need to make sure that P isn't in the last position.\n\nLet me structure this carefully.\n\nFirst, position 1 is already fixed as L. Now, positions 2, 3, 4 will be filled from the remaining letters. But position 4 cannot be P. So, first, let's consider the choices for position 4. Position 4 can be any of the remaining letters except P. Wait, but we are choosing two other letters (positions 2 and 3) from the six after L, and then the fourth position will be from the remaining five letters (since one of the two chosen for positions 2 and 3 might have been P). Wait, maybe I need to think of it as step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can split this into steps.\n\nFirst, choose the first letter: already fixed as L.\n\nThen, choose the next three letters with the restriction that the last one is not P.\n\nSo, total sequences = (number of sequences starting with L) = (number of ways to choose the remaining three letters) * (number of ways to arrange them in positions 2, 3, 4 with the last position not being P).\n\nWait, let's formalize this.\n\nNumber of sequences = (number of ways to choose the first letter: fixed as L) * (number of ways to choose the remaining three letters) * (number of permutations of those three letters with the last one not being P).\n\nAlternatively, maybe even better:\n\nNumber of sequences = (5 letters available for positions 2, 3, 4) since position 1 is already L. But we need to consider that the last position cannot be P. So, perhaps think of it as two cases: one where P is not selected for any of the remaining three positions, and one where P is selected for one of the remaining three positions. Wait, but since all three positions (2,3,4) are filled with the remaining letters. So, in total, after L, we have six letters left. We need to choose three of them (positions 2,3,4) such that the last one is not P.\n\nTherefore, the total number of sequences is equal to the number of ways to choose three letters from the remaining six (with the last one excluding P if selected) and then arrange them in positions 2,3,4.\n\nAlternatively, let's think combinatorially.\n\nFirst, select three letters out of the remaining six (P, R, O, B, E, M).

Hmm, okay. Let me think step by step. First, maybe I should start by understanding what this inequality is saying.\n\nThe expression (n + 3)(n - 7) is a product of two binomials. The \u2264 0 means that this product is less than or equal to zero. To solve this inequality, I remember that when dealing with quadratic inequalities, the critical points are where each factor equals zero. These points divide the number line into intervals where the signs of the factors don't change. Let me write down the critical points first.\n\nThe first factor is (n + 3), which equals zero when n = -3. The second factor is (n - 7), which equals zero when n = 7. So these two points, -3 and 7, will split the number line into three intervals:\n\n1. n < -3\n2. -3 \u2264 n \u2264 7\n3. n > 7\n\nNow, I need to test each interval to see where the product (n + 3)(n - 7) is non-positive (i.e., \u2264 0). Let me check each interval one by one.\n\nStarting with the first interval, n < -3. Let's pick a test value here, say n = -4. Plugging into each factor: (n + 3) becomes (-4 + 3) = -1, and (n - 7) becomes (-4 - 7) = -11. Multiplying these together: (-1)(-11) = 11, which is positive. So in this interval, the product is positive. Since we need the product to be \u2264 0, this interval doesn't contribute any solutions.\n\nNext, moving to the second interval, -3 \u2264 n \u2264 7. Let me pick a test value in the middle of this interval, say n = 0. Testing each factor: (n + 3) = 0 + 3 = 3, and (n - 7) = 0 - 7 = -7. Multiplying them: 3*(-7) = -21, which is negative. So the product here is negative, which satisfies the inequality. Therefore, the interval from -3 to 7, including both endpoints, are part of the solution set.\n\nThe third interval is n > 7. Let's pick a test value, say n = 8. Then (n + 3) = 8 + 3 = 11, and (n - 7) = 8 - 7 = 1. Multiplying them: 11*1 = 11, which is positive. Again, the product is positive here, so this interval doesn't contribute any solutions.\n\nSo combining the intervals where the product is non-positive, we have -3 \u2264 n \u2264 7. Now, the question asks for the number of integers n that satisfy this inequality. So I need to count all integers from -3 up to 7, inclusive.\n\nLet me list them out: -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Let's count how many that is. Starting from -3, each subsequent number is one more than the previous. Let me see: -3, -2 (-3 +1= -2), -1 (-2 +1= -1), 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. That's 11 numbers. Wait, let me check again. From -3 to 7 inclusive:\n\nNumber of terms in a sequence from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. Here, a = -3, b = 7. So 7 - (-3) + 1 = 7 + 3 + 1 = 11. Yes, that's correct. So there are 11 integers.\n\nBut hold on, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any numbers. Let's recount: starting at -3, then adding 1 each time until 7. Let's count step by step:\n\n-3, 0 (1), 1 (2), 2 (3), 3 (4), 4 (5), 5 (6), 6 (7), 7 (8). Wait, that's only 8 numbers. That's a mistake! Did I miscalculate the number of steps?

Hmm, let's start by recalling how to solve such inequalities. I remember that for quadratic inequalities like this, the method is similar to solving equations, but we have to consider the sign changes at the roots.\n\nFirst, let me write down the inequality again to make sure I have it right:\n\n(n + 3)(n - 7) \u2264 0\n\nAlright, so the product of two binomials is less than or equal to zero. The roots of the equation (n + 3)(n - 7) = 0 are n = -3 and n = 7. These are the points where the expression changes its sign. The solution to the inequality will be the interval(s) where the product is non-positive (i.e., \u2264 0).\n\nSince it's a closed interval inequality (\u2264 0), the solutions should include the endpoints where the expression equals zero. So, n = -3 and n = 7 are part of the solution set.\n\nNow, let me visualize this. The quadratic function f(n) = (n + 3)(n - 7) is a parabola opening upwards because the coefficient of n\u00b2 is positive. The roots are at n = -3 and n = 7, and the vertex is between them. Since the parabola opens upwards, the function will be below zero between the roots and zero outside the roots. But wait, the inequality is \u2264 0, so we need to include where the function is \u2264 0.\n\nSo, the solution to the inequality is the interval [-3, 7]. But since we are dealing with integers, we need to count all the integers from -3 to 7 inclusive.\n\nLet me list them out:\n\n-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\n\nNow, how many terms are there in this list?\n\nStarting from -3, that's 1 number. Then next is -2 (2), -1 (3), 0 (4), 1 (5), 2 (6), 3 (7), 4 (8), 5 (9), 6 (10), 7 (11). So that's 11 numbers.\n\nBut wait, let me verify that. Let me count each step:\n\nFrom -3 to 7, inclusive:\n\nNumber of integers from a to b inclusive is given by (b - a) + 1. Here, a = -3, b = 7. So (7 - (-3)) + 1 = (10) + 1 = 11. Yes, that's correct.\n\nBut let me double-check each number to make sure I didn't miss any or mistake any in.\n\nStarting at -3:\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nYes, 11 numbers. Hmm. But wait, the original inequality is (n + 3)(n - 7) \u2264 0. Let me plug in some numbers to check if this makes sense.\n\nFor example, when n = -3: ( -3 + 3)(-3 -7) = (0)(-10) = 0 \u2264 0, which is true. Similarly, n = 7: (7 +3)(7 -7) = (10)(0) = 0 \u2264 0, also true. What about n = -4? Let's compute: (-4 + 3)(-4 -7) = (-1)(-11) = 11 > 0, which doesn't satisfy the inequality. Similarly, n = 8: (8 +3)(8 -7) = (11)(1) = 11 > 0, again doesn't satisfy. So the endpoints are included, as expected.\n\nTherefore, the integers from -3 to 7 inclusive give a total of 11 numbers. So the answer should be \\boxed{11}.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm once again. Maybe there's a step I missed. Let me check the multiplication of the roots. The roots are at -3 and 7, so the interval is from -3 to 7. Since both roots are integers, but the interval is inclusive. So from -3 to 7, inclusive, the count is indeed (7 - (-3)) + 1 = 11. So 11 integers.\n\nAlternatively, if I list them all: -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Yes, 11 numbers. So seems correct.

So, the answer should be 11.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's any possible mistake here. The inequality includes equality, so when the product is zero, those points are also included. So, n = -3 and n = 7 are included. Since those are integers and counted in the list, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem counts 0 as a positive integer, but in this case, the interval is closed, so it includes 0. So, 0 is there, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers is 11.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of integers \\( n \\) that satisfy the inequality is \\boxed{", 0.5400000214576721], ["25", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful AI Assistant, designed to provided well-reasoned and detailed responses.

Hmm, let me think step by step. First, I remember that inequalities like this can often be solved by considering the critical points where each factor equals zero. These critical points divide the number line into intervals where the expression might have a consistent sign. Then, I can test each interval to see if it satisfies the inequality.\n\nAlright, let's start by finding the critical points. The expression is (n + 3)(n - 7). Setting each factor equal to zero gives n + 3 = 0 \u2192 n = -3 and n - 7 = 0 \u2192 n = 7. So the critical points are at n = -3 and n = 7. These split the number line into three intervals:\n\n1. n < -3\n2. -3 \u2264 n \u2264 7\n3. n > 7\n\nNow, I need to test each interval to check the sign of the product (n + 3)(n - 7).\n\nFor the first interval, let's pick n = -4. Plugging into (n + 3)(n - 7) gives (-4 + 3)(-4 - 7) = (-1)(-11) = 11, which is positive. Since the product is positive here and the inequality is \u2264 0, this interval doesn't satisfy the inequality. So the product is positive here.\n\nNext interval: -3 \u2264 n \u2264 7. Let's pick n = 0. Then (0 + 3)(0 - 7) = 3 * (-7) = -21, which is negative. The product is negative here, so this interval does satisfy the inequality. Let's confirm with another point, say n = 7. (7 + 3)(7 - 7) = 10 * 0 = 0, which is also okay. So from -3 to 7 inclusive, the product is negative or zero, so this interval is included.\n\nThird interval: n > 7. Let's pick n = 8. (8 + 3)(8 - 7) = 11 * 1 = 11, which is positive. Since the product is positive here and the inequality is \u2264 0, this interval doesn't satisfy the inequality.\n\nPutting it all together, the solution set is -3 \u2264 n \u2264 7. Now, the problem asks how many integers n satisfy this. So we need to find all integers n such that -3 \u2264 n \u2264 7. Let's list them out:\n\nStarting from -3, the integers are -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n\nLet me count them. Let's see: from -3 to 7 inclusive, that's 7 numbers before 7 (since we start at -3). Wait, actually, let's count step by step:\n\n-3 (1st)\n-2 (2nd)\n-1 (3rd)\n0 (4th)\n1 (5th)\n2 (6th)\n3 (7th)\n4 (8th)\n5 (9th)\n6 (10th)\n7 (11th)\n\nSo there are 11 integers. Wait, but let me check again:\n\nFrom -3 to 7 inclusive:\n\nNumbers: -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. That's 11 numbers. Hmm, that seems right.\n\nBut let me verify using another method. If I list them out: -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Yep, 11 numbers.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that maybe I missed a number? Let me check each integer between -3 and 7 inclusive:\n\nStarting at -3: yes. -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Let's count them:\n\n1. -3\n2. -2\n3. -1\n4. 0\n5. 1\n6. 2\n7. 3\n8. 4\n9. 5\n10. 6\n11. 7\n\nYes, that's 11 numbers. So the answer should be 11. But wait, I just thought, maybe I need to confirm if there are any other intervals where the product could be zero or negative. Let me check n = -3 and n = 7.

Hmm, okay, let's start by recalling that when dealing with quadratic inequalities, the critical points are often found by setting the expression equal to zero. These points divide the number line into intervals where the expression has consistent sign (either always positive or always negative). Then, we can test each interval to determine where the inequality holds.\n\nFirst, let me write down the inequality: (n + 3)(n - 7) \u2264 0. Let's expand the left-hand side to see if it simplifies. Multiplying (n + 3) and (n - 7) gives:\n\nn(n - 7) + 3(n - 7) = n\u00b2 - 7n + 3n - 21 = n\u00b2 - 4n - 21.\n\nWait, but expanding wasn't necessary. The original factors are (n + 3) and (n - 7). So, maybe it's easier just to consider the critical points first.\n\nThe expression (n + 3)(n - 7) is a quadratic, so the critical points are where each factor is zero. So:\n\nn + 3 = 0 \u21d2 n = -3\n\nn - 7 = 0 \u21d2 n = 7\n\nSo these are the critical points. On a number line, these split the real numbers into three intervals:\n\n1. n < -3\n\n2. -3 \u2264 n \u2264 7\n\n3. n > 7\n\nBut since it's an inequality \u2264 0, the solution will be the intervals where the product is less than or equal to zero. The product of two real numbers is negative when one is positive and the other is negative. Let's check each interval:\n\n1. n < -3: Let's pick n = -4. Then ( -4 + 3 ) = -1 and ( -4 - 7 ) = -11. Multiplying gives (-1)(-11) = 11, which is positive. So this interval doesn't work.\n\n2. -3 \u2264 n \u2264 7: Let's pick n = 0. Then (0 + 3) = 3 and (0 - 7) = -7. Multiplying gives 3*(-7) = -21, which is negative. So this interval works.\n\n3. n > 7: Let's pick n = 8. Then (8 + 3) = 11 and (8 - 7) = 1. Multiplying gives 11*1 = 11, which is positive. So this interval doesn't work.\n\nAdditionally, we need to check the critical points themselves. At n = -3: ( -3 + 3 ) = 0 and ( -3 -7 ) = -10. Multiplying gives 0*(-10) = 0, which satisfies the inequality since it's \u2264 0. Similarly, at n = 7: (7 + 3) = 10 and (7 -7) = 0. Multiplying gives 10*0 = 0, which is also \u2264 0. So both critical points are included in the solution.\n\nTherefore, combining the intervals and critical points, the inequality holds when n is in [-3, 7], including the endpoints.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the number of integer solutions in this interval. So we need to find all integers n such that -3 \u2264 n \u2264 7.\n\nLet's list the integers from -3 up to and including 7:\n\n-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n\nLet's count them. Starting from -3:\n\n1. -3\n\n2. -2\n\n3. -1\n\n4. 0\n\n5. 1\n\n6. 2\n\n7. 3\n\n8. 4\n\n9. 5\n\n10. 6\n\n11. 7\n\nSo that's 11 integers.

Hmm, let's see. I remember that when you have a product of two binomials like this, the sign of the product depends on the signs of each binomial. The product will be zero when either (n + 3) is zero or (n - 7) is zero. But since we're talking about inequalities, we need to figure out when their product is less than or equal to zero.\n\nFirst, let me factor the inequality to make it easier. The given inequality is (n + 3)(n - 7) \u2264 0. So, both binomials can be considered. Let's think about when each is positive or negative.\n\nThe binomial (n + 3) changes sign at n = -3. Let's see:\n\n- When n < -3, (n + 3) is negative.\n- When n > -3, (n + 3) is positive.\n- At n = -3, (n + 3) = 0.\n\nSimilarly, the binomial (n - 7) changes sign at n = 7.\n\n- When n < 7, (n - 7) is negative.\n- When n > 7, (n - 7) is positive.\n- At n = 7, (n - 7) = 0.\n\nSo, when we multiply these two binomials, their product's sign depends on the signs of both. Let me try to analyze each interval between the critical points: n < -3, -3 < n < 7, and n > 7.\n\n1. **For n < -3:**\n   - Both binomials (n + 3) and (n - 7) are negative.\n   - Multiplying two negatives gives a positive product.\n   - So, in this interval, the product is positive. But since we are looking for \u2264 0, this interval won't contribute any solutions here.\n\n2. **For -3 < n < 7:**\n   - The first binomial (n + 3) is positive because n > -3, and the second binomial (n - 7) is negative because n < 7.\n   - Multiplying a positive and a negative gives a negative product.\n   - Therefore, in this interval, the product is negative. Since the inequality is \u2264 0, this interval is part of the solution set.\n\n3. **For n > 7:**\n   - Both binomials are positive because n > 7.\n   - Multiplying two positives gives a positive product.\n   - So, here the product is positive, which doesn't satisfy the inequality.\n\nAdditionally, the critical points where the product is zero are n = -3 and n = 7. Since the inequality is \u2264 0, these points are included in the solution set.\n\nPutting this all together, the solution set is the interval -3 \u2264 n \u2264 7.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the number of integer solutions. So, we need to find all integers from -3 up to and including 7.\n\nLet's list them out:\n\n-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n\nCounting these, let's see: starting at -3, each integer increases by 1 each time. Let's count step by step:\n\nFrom -3 to 7, inclusive, how many integers is that?\n\nThe formula for the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1.\n\nSo, 7 - (-3) + 1 = 7 + 3 + 1 = 11.\n\nWait, let me verify that. If you have from -3 to 7, that's 7 - (-3) = 10 intervals, but since it's inclusive, you add 1, so 10 + 1 = 11. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, there are 11 integers in total. Let me check each one to be sure:\n\n-3: valid\n-2: valid\n-1: valid\n0: valid\n1: valid\n2: valid\n3: valid\n4: valid\n5: valid\n6: valid\n7: valid\n\nYes, all 11 are integers satisfying the inequality.

I need to find how many integers n satisfy the inequality (n + 3)(n - 7) \u2264 0. Hmm, quadratic inequalities can sometimes be tricky, but maybe I can figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with quadratic expressions, the solutions usually correspond to the intervals where the expression is positive or negative. Since this is a product of two binomials, let me first find the roots where each factor equals zero. The roots for (n + 3) = 0 is n = -3, and for (n - 7) = 0 it's n = 7. These roots divide the number line into three intervals:\n\n1. n < -3\n2. -3 \u2264 n \u2264 7\n3. n > 7\n\nNow, I need to test each interval to see where the product (n + 3)(n - 7) is less than or equal to zero. Let me pick a test point from each interval.\n\nFor the first interval, n < -3. Let's pick n = -4. Plugging into the expression: (-4 + 3)(-4 - 7) = (-1)(-11) = 11. Which is positive, so the product is positive here.\n\nSecond interval, -3 \u2264 n \u2264 7. Let's pick n = 0. (0 + 3)(0 - 7) = 3 * (-7) = -21. That's negative. So here the product is negative.\n\nThird interval, n > 7. Let's try n = 8. (8 + 3)(8 - 7) = 11 * 1 = 11. Positive again.\n\nSo the inequality (n + 3)(n - 7) \u2264 0 holds in the interval between -3 and 7, inclusive. That is, all real numbers n such that -3 \u2264 n \u2264 7. Now, the question is asking for how many integers n satisfy this.\n\nSo I need to count all integers from -3 up to 7, inclusive. Let me list them out:\n\n-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n\nLet me count them to check. Starting from -3: that's 1 number. Then -2 is 2nd, -1 is 3rd, 0 is 4th, 1 is 5th, 2 is 6th, 3 is 7th, 4 is 8th, 5 is 9th, 6 is 10th, 7 is 11th. So that's 11 integers.\n\nWait, but let me verify that 11 is correct. The interval from -3 to 7 inclusive is 7 - (-3) + 1 = 7 + 3 +1 = 11. Yep, that makes sense. So there are 11 integers that satisfy the inequality.\n\nBut let me just double-check. Maybe I missed something in the count. Let's check each interval again.\n\nStarting at -3: -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. That's 11 numbers. Yes, that's right. So I think the answer is 11. Hmm, but let me just confirm with another method.\n\nAlternatively, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So here, 7 - (-3) +1 = 11. Correct. So that's consistent.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the number of integers between two numbers, including both endpoints, is one more than the difference. So 7 - (-3) = 10, then 10 +1 =11.
