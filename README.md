# Thinking_LLM
This repo is to implement the reasoning method of DeepSeek R1-zero. 

The code is based on this repo: [Open R1](https://github.com/huggingface/open-r1), and in our repo, we apply a different reward: reflection reward. 

The reflection reward is a novel reward function that encourages the agent to reflect on its own thinking process and improve its reasoning skills, and it is added to the original reward.
